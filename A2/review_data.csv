0,0,7,0," Cool SF, but dumb writing, and teens
","SF about how humanity's sole survivors were on space stations for 100 years after Earth was rendered uninhabitable by nuclear war. The stations are failing, so criminals (juveniles) are being sent to Earth prematurely and desperately. Teens are so handy for TV, people like to look at them, and dramatic conflict can be easily stirred up on the pretence of immaturity. Excessive drama is not just excused, but mandated, to seem realistic. Anyway, the forest was gorgeous, but with startling and unexpected elements, the girls were pretty, I liked the concept. But there was quite a bit that was just bone dumb. For instance, the stations are running out of time, in their desperately closed ecosystem, so they execute people, for any misdemeanour, by flushing them, alive, with their bodies full of water and nutrients, out into space along with an airlock full of air."

","I like the plot though, but these characters are so boring and annoying. They do stupid things and that makes the story less enjoyable."
2,0,2,0," Had potential but quickly ruined with cliche teenage issues
",Couldn't get past 10 minutes of episode 1. The show had potention with its story line but it's ruined with the overly used cliche teenage drama and terribly played out issues that even 10 year old kids are smarter to work out. Was painful to watch the first episode.. Very painful

4,0,7,0," Just watch and stop thinking
","Once you can see the premise of this program, the healthy thing is to turn off the brain and just look at the screen to see what the screenwriters come up with. Some turns are interesting and surprising, there is originality (sometimes) that is a pleasant surprise. Unfortunately the writers themselves exaggerate the level of stupidity of the protagonists, who do stupid thing after stupid thing, no matter how teenagers they are. I'm afraid that even with the spectator's brain off, that's already too hard to swallow.Another thing that is surprising is the schizophrenic personality of the characters. Many are transformed from stupid to wise at one time or another, many bad guys are transformed into good guys without explanation, then they become stupid or evil again without explanation. As I said, however, turn off your brain and be surprised.In any case, it will always be more fun than watching plants grow."
5,0,6,0," Entertaining, but can't take it seriously
","The main problem I have with this is the clich√© characters: The slutty annoying attention whore (Octavia), the douchey guys that only care about getting laid (Jasper and Monty), the girl with troubled past (Clarke), whose sole purpose in this pilot episode is constant exposition, and the rebellious ones that have seemingly no redeeming qualities as characters yet and just like to be dicks for fun (John and his gang) for the most part. Whose idea was it to send a bunch of children down to earth? Why not adult prisoners?There were so many damn lens flares in this it got quite distracting. I had to check that this wasn't made by JJ Abrams because it looked like it was. Additionally, the obvious mainstream pop music that played every other scene got pretty annoying. The show in the end is entertaining enough to keep watch, as long as I don't take it too seriously."
6,0,7,0," Fun and breezy
","Young adult sci-fi. Haven't we have too many of those already? Well, the first episode of ""The 100"" shows that, if you do it well enough, a done-to-death idea can be fun enough.Here we have all the ingredients of these kind of shows: 100 under eighteen people are sent back to Earth from a space station, after humanity had to run away (some kind of nuclear war). This 100 very mature and resourceful people (cough cough) include everyone in a 101 YA sci-fi: nerd guy, reckless girl, god-complex suffering guy, etc etc. You will know from second one who is going to get together with, and then who is going to split with to start a relationship with... The summon of originality. The group dynamics don't differ much from this idea: who is the leader, who wants to be the leader, who doesn't but will be...But even if we have seen this a hundred (sorry?) times, the package is nice, the young actors do a good job, and the adults (which include people from ""Lost"", ""Battlestar Galactica"" and others) too, and it's always nice to have some dystopian series to watch, as it is easy on the eye and fast paced. And it may hold one or two cards up its sleeve yet."
7,0,6,0," Good plot, bad execution
","The plot is very interesting imo, and I think the show still has potential after this episode. But man did I want to stop watching halfway through. The pacing is overly quick, meaning we hardly get to know any of these characters. Almost all of them fall into predictable stereotypes, and there is no real substance to any of them besides maybe Wells. The dialogue is really cringe, and the exposition is laughable. Instead of finding things out as we go along, people say things like ""Octavia! The girl who spent 16 years hiding on the Ark"". Nobody says things like that in real life, and it pulled me out of the scene. Then there's something like ""We're back, b*****s!"", which got my eyes rolling, and takes us out of the scene again, because that sounds like something a teen in the 2010s would say, not someone in the future. It's immersion breaking and simply bad writing. But overall, it was a cringe yet pretty fun episode that could lead to better things down the road."
8,0,6,0," Has Potential, But Misses The Mark
","The 100 has been on our screens for more than half a decade, and I have never been a fan, I watched the first season and gave up on it.I watched the first season with my youngest son who was 8 at the time (13 now) and he was instantly hooked, It was a slog for me to get through the first season and I gave up. Fast forward to this year, and whilst waiting for season 6 to end (he likes to binge watch them) he decided to start them again and we made a deal, I would watch every episode of this, and once we were up to date, he would watch every episode of a show of my choosing!! I'm thinking Taxi.My biggest problem with the pilot episode is that it is too 'teen friendly,' The cast is full of impossibly good looking teenagers (all with great hair) who can't really act.Most of its characters are ridiculously cliche (especially the teenagers) Octavia Blake (Marie Avgeropulos) is painful to watch!! The wannabe head cheerleader/wannabe bad girl rolled into one. Like most of the cast, she is good looking but can not act. Her bad boy leader of the pack rebel brother Blake (Bob Morley) is better, but he is kind of bland. Monty (Christopher Larkin) and Jasper (Devon Bostick) are the horny comedy duo and are ok, Finn (Thomas McDonell) is the good looking rebel who Octavia fancies, but he only seems to have eyes for Clarke (Eliza Taylor) and he is a disaster, he is to blame for two deaths early on and doesn't care, its quickly forgotten on the next scene!! Then there is our heroine Clarke, we know she is the hero due to her monologue and her do the right thing, sensible attitude.On the Ark we meet Abby Griffin (Paige Turco) who is take charge and probably the best actor in the pilot. Marcus Kane (Henry Ian Cusick) with too much guy liner and suspiciously dark hair is in full on pantomime villain mode and Thelonious Jaha (Isaiah Washington) isn't given much to do, but he has an important role.Overall I'm reminded why I didn't like it."

","Too many people kissing and stripping down to underwear don't make a show. Lucky us, the second episode of ""The 100"", ""Earth Skills"" offers a little bit more than just that.So, we lost one member... oh, no, we actually didn't. The show trips itself up by doing that cheap trick of having someone seem to die but actually not. Clarke knows they can't leave behind their friend, and puts up a team to get him back and try to discover a little bit more of what's going on on Earth. Finn, on the other hand, doesn't seem to happy to be in danger (who would?) and Wells is having a case of I-need-you-to-look-at-me! (lucky for us, it's actually quite toned down). As I said in the previous episode, nothing new under the sun.This second episode tries to put the dynamics of the 100 more clearly out there, but one has to wonder what all the other 80-something people are doing with all the free time they have in their hands. Bellamy tries to make his grip on the team stronger, but he still seems quite weak as a ambiguous leader. And his henchman John Murphy (Richard Harmon) is so one-side note its amazing (maybe he will start having a change of mind some episodes further down?). Up on the Ark, Clarke's mother is putting some things in motion, but the power struggle is for now less interesting that what's happening on the ground.For now, ""The 100"" keeps being fun sci-fi, with some nice references and good pace, but with too many people making eyes to each other. And do they really have to get their clothes off and run into any stream or river they see?"

On the Ark, Abby (Paige Turco) is determined to prove Earth is habitable, and enlists a mechanic named Raven (Linsey Morgan) to craft an escape pod.Another so-so episode that ends on a cliffhanger, as always in a teen drama, we have a love triangle. Clarke (the gorgeous Eliza Taylor) is the object of affection of both Finn and Wells. Finn is all cocky arrogance, whilst Wells is a nice guy and supportive friend to her (he only get sent to jail to ensure he could be with her when she got sent to earth. He is constantly teased about Clarke, by Bellamy ""She doesn't even see you"" and is bullied by Murphy, who is already established as the bad boy of the show, even if it is Bellamy who is in charge. Just don't disobey him.I was critical of the acting in the pilot episode, and whilst Taylor and Morley are ok, Avgeropoulous is still bad and Eli Goree is the best of the bunch followed by Richard Harmon, who makes Murphy very easy to dislike."

I remember experiencing water and grass for the first time through my child, it was an experience I will never forget.

","In the end, it's relationships. If the characters are well developed, we can overcome some shortcomings of the plot, as we care about them.""The 100"" takes one step closer to making us care about that bunch of misfits that are on Earth hoping to stay alive through thick and thin. This third episode is a very solid one, and it also shows that the writers are not going to shy away from taking some hard decisions.Jasper is more dead than alive, but they took him back to camp, so Clarke, with Finn and Wells go out in search of a plant that may help him get better. On the way, they get ""attacked"" by a fog (""Lost"" style). Will they get back in time to save their friend? And will anything happen to the hunting party led by Bellamy?As said above, this episode is quite well written. There's still some overacting, and some things just happen too conveniently, but the show is going in the right direction. Clarke, Finn, etc, are being well developed through their relationships, interactions, and some flashbacks from their time back on the Ark (too many, actually). But you will start feeling something for them, for their motives, fears and desires. And when a show can make the viewer feel that, it's a winner."

22,3,7,0," Ups, the marmalade
","Stanford-prison-experiment patient Murphy is taking his job as Bellamy's second in command too seriously, so when his knife is found and people suspect him of killing Wells, all hell breaks loose.This fourth episode of season one is an action packed episode, filled with quite some good moments and nice plot developments. The series is keeping the pace high and not letting the viewer fall asleep. There's still too much ""love"" going around (it's been one week, so a kiss or two should be expected, though). Putting one-note character Murphy as the center of the episode lets violence take center stage, as he is not one to take things down and Richard Harmon does a good job of making the character feel more human than till now.On the Ark, Clarke's mother decides to get into a pod and get to Earth to see if her daughter is fine. This helps to keep the tension of power struggle between her and Councillor Marcus Kane (how can he keep that hair-style?).On the down side, there's also one of those cheesy moments when characters have to act, time running down, but decide they have time to talk, hug and cry. Otherwise, great episode."
23,3,8,1," Stronger Episode
","This was easily the best episode this season, but while the writing can be pretty fantastic, the acting is all over the map. The amount of time between reveals was a bit short, however, which took some of the wind out of the sail of the episodes two big plot points. That said, with the large shakeups this episode did unleash, hopefully the episodes going forward will have more material to work with.The series has potential, and barring some missteps, this was a change for the better. And ultimately, that's about the best way to summarize the midseason mark. As an individual episode, it was fairly decent, but the amount of variables it has thrown in to the mix now, with several threats on the ground surface, and questions about whether or not establishing contact to the station above will be even possible with the political actions underway spaceside, this could help make things better, by going in two polar directions: Either by shrinking the amount of groups to worry about, and thus giving both the individuals and the threats more focus time, or by expanding them, and thus minimizing the required amount of ""fluff"" episodes needed to keep the universe interesting.Either way, this was perhaps the episode that made me the most excited for the series going forward."

With lives on stake, will they be able to overcome Bellamy?""The 100"" continues to surprise. If in previous episodes they hadn't been afraid of killing off some characters we were starting to care for, while also keeping the tension and not making the series a gore-fest, in this new episode is a fight against time, with many more lives at stake than till now.Of course, the show can't make us care about 300 people in just one episode, but they go the route of fleshing out some of the people we didn't know till now. One, two scenes, that show they are human as all the protagonists, and giving them the chance to shine makes the threat that hangs over their heads something we will care about. They are not faceless anymore.Oh, and Finn has a problem, as he now has Ark-girlfriend and Earth-girlfriend.

Deplorable Kane (Henry Ian Cusick) is still a cartoon villain with silly hair though.The dynamic between Bellamy and Clarke (Eliza Taylor) is the main focal point of the show, he is not the selfish prick he seemed to be in the first couple of episodes and through his love for his sister and hints at back story we are seeing there is more to him and his actions. There scenes are the best acted ones, they play well off each other.The anticipated Clarke, Finn Raven love triangle was quickly brushed over with Clarke removing herself from the equation ""I was around, passibly cute and now it is over.""

Bellamy's team going into grounder territory gives us the chance of some thrilling moments and also some other scary ones. That the grounders know the territory and have better weapons makes for a one-sided fight, which helps keeping the viewer on the edge of their seats.

Otherwise, Earth has become everyone's ground, and the better for it. Bellamy is becoming one of the most fleshed out characters, and he takes center in this action packed episode.

The Grounders and the 100 see things very differently, and also Diana's faction and everyone else on the Ark. Luckily for us, the show, even if it does so in a little bit heavy- handed way, tries to offer both views. And the actors, more comfortable with their roles, do a good job with the material. One of the nicest points of ""The 100"" is how the two bad guys from the first episodes (Bellamy and Councillor Kane) have become more sympathetic to the viewer, showing their backgrounds and their weaknesses.

And in the Ark, they just have some hours left before the place dies, and with it, everyone that survived when the exodus ship left for Earth.As said above, this episode is a very neat one. Many situations are developed (and it keeps others in secret, leaving us to wonder what has happened to some characters), and the group identity for the 100, whose bases were put in the pilot and developed in all the episodes since, becomes to fruition. Clarke may be the real leader, and Bellamy the strong right arm, but this is a group that has and knows that has to work as a team to survive. It's a group that feels that they belong to Earth, that they deserve to be there and make a living.

","The last episode of season one of ""The 100"" has everything a young show could desire: characters that may die or not, some mysteries that may or may not be solved, cool action, and some missteps.With the big fight between the Grounders and the 100 almost there, everyone of the surviving 100 is nervous and trigger happy. We will get what we expect, and a little bit more: action, desperation, some sacrifices and well rounded situations. It doesn't break any new ground, but it doesn't really need to. It all is done quite flawlessly and even if the effects are a little bit cheap, the action will satisfy any fan of the show. Probably every character has their moment to shine.And will anyone from the Ark survive the re-entry through Earth's atmosphere? The appearance of the adults on Earth would change a lot of the dynamics of the show.The ending reeks a little bit of other sci-fi shows, and it points for a new direction in the second season of the series. It will be for sure a change of pace, which could be interesting or maybe alienate its fans. But that's for the future..."

","So I watched the first season of The 100. WOW! I hope the writers got fired. These juvenile ex-cons on Earth make every bad, incomprehensible, and immoral decision and are guaranteed to take a course of action that goes against logic, reasoning, and common sense. After a while it becomes predictable and you just have to think of the total opposite of what might be right, or rational, or expected to realise that inexperienced and uneducated teenagers (or the angry parents of them who now wished they'd used contraception) wrote this godforsaken rubbish.There are no plot twists or branches that make sense or are within the bounds of normality. No nail-biters or edge of your seat suspense cliff-hangers. Only mindblowing ineptitude and ridiculousness of Biblical proportions. 99% of the time characters fail at every level and the other 1% doesn't make up for the ludicrous storyline and unbelievable events that take place. This was like watching the Simpsons cast in an episode of Lost - from the mind of a socially challenged adolescent with a carte blanche to create the dumbest story for a dumbest story award. What a complete load of garbage from beginning to end.1/10 because I couldn't award it a fully deserving ZERO!"

","In the first season, when the 100 arrived on Earth, they were supposed to be alone. We soon discovered they were not, and the Grounders joined the fun. Close to the end of season one, the Reapers appeared. The end of the season teased us with a new group, on top of the Ark survivors arriving on Earth.And here we have the dystopian society that has gone through an end-of-humanity war and have become moles who live underground in a seemingly peaceful and cheerful society.You know it's gonna end bad.The idea of a new group, one that has kept its ""civilization"" but its probably hiding a darker secret than the Grounders is not an original one, and they show will have to tread with care not to become a caricature of itself. On the other hand, correctly done, it can add to the fun. In this first episode, it does, as it adds some interesting questions: how come they need people from over the ground, why are the interested in the people that came back from the Ark, what did they do with Anya...? Some of the 100 seem to like the change, to have a roof, food and be clean. Clarke, being smart, is not.On the ground, Finn and Bellamy are having another kind of problem. The people from the Ark are back, in with it, both of them are losing their position of power and becoming ""children"" again. Kane is going to take control, but for how long and how is what the show will have to answer. Bellamy and Finn have been free for too long, and it's difficult to cage a wild animal. Talking of wild animals, Murphy is also alive. The show has used him as a bogeyman, but it seems more humanity will be infused to his character. Another bad that becomes I-really-had-a-messed-time-growing-up-but-I'm-good-deep- down? Let's see.So many new plot developments, change of pace, and interesting new characters and situations make for a good start for season two."

Clarke is the only one in the underground community that seems to think that something smells fishy, and, in an interesting turn of events, Jaha finds a survivor in the Ark. A baby.One good thing ""The 100"" does in this episode is keeping all the story-lines interesting. Murphy change of heart? Check. Raven's health? Check. Kane's desire to be the boss? Check. Etc. etc... The dynamics had to change after last season's ending and the beginning of this second, and the show has done an almost flawless job in doing so. The fan of the first season will probably be enjoying these first episodes of the second.But to keep a show interesting, and more in the case of a serialized one, you have to make the characters face more and more challenging threats, more and more dangerous foes. This second season of ""The 100"" is bringing us the underground community. Is it more dangerous than the Grounders? That they don't seem to be as savage as them makes us believe that, deep down, they must be horrible (but all of them?).""The 100"" keeps being quite interesting.

What are we willing to sacrifice for our own security. The classic freedom-security conundrum. Of course, it keeps dealing with all of this in a simple and a little bit heavy- handed way, but it's enough that it is asking it and that, while doing so, it keeps being a lot of fun.Is Kane going the ""I-need-all-the-power"" route or will he remember his change of heart that occurred in the Ark? Is the unexpected and dangerous team of Anya and Clarke going to be able to run away from Mount Weather? Are Jasper and Monty going to find what happened to Clarke? And what about Lincoln?So many things happen, and the pace is so frantic, that you forget about Jaha or Raven, as you will be wondering all the time about what is happening at that moment, in front of the screen. ""The 100"" is getting to a point where it is not boring, always rising interesting questions. But some of the characters's personality development are a little bit suspect. Like Finn's. So quiet, thoughtful and smart in the first season, he is getting Bellamized (Murphyzied?) too fast. And even if the show does a good job in making its characters's actions justified, sometimes it's in danger of going over the fence.But with lots of action, and some food for thought, ""The 100"" keeps being quality sci-fi."

On top of that, there haven't been many ""important"" casualties in the characters's body count, so we have a very stretched list (we just need some interesting Reapers...). Consequence: characters that disappear. For example, in the previous episode, Raven was conspicuous by her absence.That's not to say that the episode is a bad one. Jaha's storyline is a mysterious and interesting one, and it remembers us that there's supposed to be people affected by radiation (visible consequences). The ""sand people"" may be an important part of the show from now on. Or they may be not. But their addition has helped in showing a new part of this beautiful-horrible-dangerous world the people from the Ark have gotten back to.Anya and Clarke's prison break is also interesting enough. Two strong people, who hate each other but have to join forces against another one. The enemy of my enemy... Are they going to make a real team, is their interaction going to help in the Grounders-Ark relationship? The episode teases us with one and the other, and it is the better for it.Strangely, there are also some (more than normal) incongruities in things that happen in the episode.

Once down a path, it is very difficult to come back.But the show has lots more to offer. Kane's mission to make peace with the Grounders is nicely done. Kane is showing he can be stupid, but at least he's not heartless, and he knows that the path his govern was going down was a bad one (Finn should talk with him).And then there's Mount Weather. Monty is getting smarter and Jasper... well, he seems to be in love. That gives the chance to the people at Mount Weather to plan something bad... very bad. Will they get through with their plan? Well, if not, they still have Lincoln and their quest to make him a Reaper. They are becoming more than just a big bad. They are becoming a lunatic big bad.

All the usual suspects. At Mount Weather Monty and Jasper are growing suspicious after Clarke's disappearance. And Jaha and Kane have a decision to make.Some of the story lines are starting to merge. Kane and Jaha's showdown is an interesting one, with both characters (and actors) showing their opinions (and range) about their survival, sacrifice and commitment. Their part gives the episode the ""deep moment"" part. On the action side, we have some nice discoveries by the team that goes to Mount Weather (and of course, those pesky stupid extras that you can bet will do something stupid to endanger everyone). And if we didn't feel the balance between action and thinking was good enough, there's the tension rising at Mount Weather, the suspicion and distrust.A little bit for everyone (characters and viewers)."

It's a shame because it has great potential and I really did like some of the tense early episodes. Especially when the plot was split between what was going on in space on on the ground. I suppose the fast pace of each episode is one of the strong points and the show has not lost that but there are simply just too many inconsistencies and implausibilities now and you just can't ignore them any more as they're turning into the shows great weakness. So Raven has complex surgery to remove the bullet (without any anesthesia), she ends up with one leg paralyzed but now strolls through the woods like the rest of them because a guy builds some kind of support for her? Give me a break! Goodbye, 100, you had your moments but it's time to call it a day. And there won't be any happy returns!"

","This episode is a Lincoln centered one, as Clarke and friends will try to bring him back from his state, while the threat of the Grounders attack hovers above them all. In Mount Weather, sleazy people continue with their shady things.This episode is a solid one, even if the pace slows down. A big part of it is about the possibility or not of bringing poor Lincoln back to humanity, while also thinking about a way to make peace with the Grounders. The chance of bringing the Reapers back would be an upside, not only because of it by itself, but because the Grounders would be thankful. A pact would be beneficial for both sides, as the Mount Weather people have their own potent and dangerous arms. In this respect, ""The 100"" does a good job of showing everyone's options, opinions and motivations, and why Finn's acts have had repercussions. The show's decision of making him a little bit nuts is a strange one, because he wasn't a violent character, but we can accept that love can make people do very very stupid things.Will Grounders and Ark people be able to unite and assault Mount Weather? It may all depend on a person. Or maybe they will come up with a last second plan... Nice storytelling at work."

","Finn is in a dangerous position. After Lincoln's recovery, the Grounders have accepted a treaty, but they ask for Finn's head, as he has to answer for his actions. Of course, Clarke, Raven and the others are not very happy about that. But some people from the Ark think that it's better to sacrifice Finn that to let the situation escalate.That Finn is an important character is obvious. We have known him since the first episode of the show, he was Clarke's first ""love"" on the ground, he was thoughtful, he wanted everyone to be cool with each other... But everyone's reaction to his behavior in previous episodes is a little bit of a stretch, as the show decides to ditch any possibility of the characters thinking coolly. With all that's going on it's more or less understandable, but it all reeks of the necessity of stretching the tension as much as possible. If any of those pesky extras had gone trigger happy, they would have been given a trial in a second. But Finn being Finn, it seems that he killing 16 people is forgivable. The fact that everyone cares about him is OK, that everyone seems so cold about the Grounders's deaths is, as said above, just an excuse to make his plight, his fear of death, the tension, stretch. And stretched it is. In that respect, the Grounders are shown to be less violent than they were before. They have actually become quite tame.It all does for an emotional episode (what can they do to save Finn), but foreseeable (the outcome can be seen from the first second of the episode).

Somebody (Finn) does a really evil thing, and because he is supposedly one of us and so he is not held accountable. There should have been no question that he should be held accountable for his actions of murdering so many. Justice is justice. Just because he is one of the spacers (like being American) it is OK for him to be responsible for the deaths of many of the grounders (compare to what is allowed if they were called Arabs). The Moral answer would have been to hold him accountable. There could be considered morality issues with who is responsible for determining his guilt, but his guilt it pretty obvious, so it is easy to determine guilt. What the punishment should be is another issue, but life is pretty cheap on Earth in this period, so death would be reasonable."

Yes the grounders are brutal, but really, they're insignificant faced with the full might of the most powerful military might on the planet.

Regardless of the fact that they were warriors, that was a much worse death being incinerated the way they were and in the numbers as well. SMH"
81,21,8,1," Our leaders are children
","There's a pact! And of course, not everyone's happy about that. At Mount Weather the group springs to action. And Clarke has some problems with ghosts.This episode is a slow paced one, but the better for it, because it keeps the tension at a high level, and adds a new layer to the proceedings: are Grounders and Ark people going to be able to work together or is the ticking bomb going to explode? Both teams offer many perspectives and ideas, from Raven's desire for revenge, to Kane's thoughtful words, and Alycia Debnam-Carey's Lexa way too smart Grounders leader. In a society full of violent and dangerous people, she seems too cool to had gotten into power. The show follows the it's-just-like-this explanation of not explaining it, and we can accept it, as she is a smart character.But that her and Clarke are both leaders, just teenagers, is somewhat difficult to explain. Kane's words at the beginning of the episode telling how both groups are leaded by children at least makes the characters recognize it. As Machiavelli said, fortune favors the younger, because they have more energy and desire.It's pretty obvious that more tensions between Grounders and Ark people will happen. How next episodes deal with this will show if ""The 100"" can keep its quality.And with the lives of Monty, Jasper and the others on the line, will they arrive on time to Mount Weather? ""The 100"" is treading now well known sci-fi territory. But the production values and the acting and plot development keeps it being great."

","Born from fear. ""Survival of the Fittest"" is really about hate. And fear. Grounders, Ark-people, Mount Weather people, it's all about their survival, so fear from dying becomes hate, and hate makes them take stupid decisions.Grounders and Ark people keep walking a tightrope, everything on the line. Fear of losing power, hate about past slights, makes one or two situations go further than they should. Darkness keeps permeating everything around them, and so, the feeling of dread is high. In that respect, this episode is another good one.But the show is not playing it safe, so it decides to expand on two more story lines. Lincoln and Bellamy's plan to enter Mount Weather is fraught with danger. Will they be able to get inside? How can they get through without being discovered? Is this the start of a beautiful friendship? This one(two)man-mission by Bellamy is nicely done, and it teases us which much more to come if he gets inside the complex.Talking about beautiful friendships... Jaha keeps his path to become a prophet, and harbors an interesting obsession about bringing his people to the magnificent City of Light. On this religious trip he decides Murphy would be a nice partner. Jaha is showing all the signs of one who believes he has a call, talking about god and being a leader, etc etc. This new strand is also an interesting one, which may further the world of ""The 100"" and stress the religious aspect, which till now has been kept on a tight leash. Religion and sci-fi make for interesting partners, so lets see if they explore it further.For now, all this plot development makes for an interesting second season episode."

He seems reluctant to use the kids from the Ark. Will he discover what his son and Dr. Tsing are doing? Jasper is really nervous about Monty and Harper's disappearance. And back outside, Clarke, Raven and the others are worried, as they haven't got any news from Bellamy.That Bellamy (even though Clarke is the leader, and there are other important characters) has become the one ""with heart"" hasn't been clearer than it's in this episode. Bob Morley is a good enough actor (capable of more than just blank stares), and the show is giving him more than enough options to express emotions. Till this moment, the Mount Weather people were basically sleazy, ignorant or dangerous. In this one, through his eyes, Mount Weather people become more human than ever. Sadly, the show also uses some cheap tricks to do so, but it's a sin than can be forgiven.But that's not the only good aspect of this episode, probably the best of the series so far. Tension is high, there's not too much action but it's greatly done, and the characters that the fan has learn to care about are given development. Probably Octavia going native is the one that's rushed the most. But ""The 100"" is one of those few shows which can make the viewer care about all the characters, and which offer more than just white & black situations.

On top of that, Jaha reappears, as he keeps with his insane quest for the City of Light.Jaha's side quest (with Murphy's collaboration) keeps ticking the boxes. Desert, sheephook, Jaha and his followers, it all follows the book. It's interesting in the way that it'll probably bring a new danger to the Ark-Grounders, but for now, it's just the obsession of a crazy man. And desert. Good but not great.The important plot right now, the Mount Weather vs Ark-Grounders, turns really dark in this episode, inside and outside. Big decisions, big consequences, with lots of violence, dark moments and unexpected outcomes. It's neatly done (if you can say neatly here), and it's surprisingly ambiguous. It's not the calm before the storm (even if the pace is slower than in the previous episode), but a kick in the face of everyone that expects easy answers to complicated questions. With the end of the second season close by, the show will have to take care to end on a high note, but that it's not struggling and filling time is notable."

This episode is amazingly brutal.Back in camp, there's a sniper, and there're a lot of people to rescue. Or not. Abby, Kane, Indra... All three of them have survived, but none of them seem to be to happy about what's going on. Will poor Kane survive? There's a lot of talking too, as characters try to see through the situation, through each other's decisions, through their desires and fears. It's nicely done, and it gives perspective.But the best part is the uprising at Mount Weather. Jasper and his team are tired of taking it down, and the way they react is pure and unadulterated action. Great choreography, great ideas, great action in general. Some moments are surprising, unexpected, and will not let the viewer rest for even a second. How did they pack so many outstanding moments in just a 40- minute episode is a wonder. It has one or two little missteps, but more than forgivable when you have so much action and so nicely done. Actually it's quite bloody, something the show teases us with constantly. Not for the queasy. In this episode, there will be blood.Superb level for what was supposed to be just a YA adaptation."

","Hilarious battle shut down, completely at odds with the established actions of the Grounders, they all packed it down and clocked out like shift workers on the illogical words of their commander, it all went down as smoothly as a casual conversation apparently where as the whole 2 seasons established the Grounders were kind of difficult to get into peace talks with to put it mildly.
So much for blood for blood, they walked out of the handshake deal with less than what they walked in with and scurried off like a bunch of school kids aimlessly wandering home and chatting about their favorite movie stars.

","That ""The 100"", even if it had its share of shortcomings, didn't seem to take the easy way, was easy to see from early on. Jaha's son's death at the beginning of the series, or Finn's one in the middle of the second season showed that ""The 100"" was not afraid of taking decisions, even if they were the wrong ones.For some viewers, what happens in this episode will leave them baffled and/or angry. Because it's not what one expects of the showdown between the Ark-Grounders vs Mount Weather. Is it a good decision? Let's see. For now it's more than a worthwhile one.""The 100"" falls on one of the problems that serialized series usually have: the need to keep things going. So it takes a cheap decision. Not bad, but cheap. It has taken a couple from the beginning till now. But this one is probably the biggest.The episode is centered around the last big battle, with the Mount Weather surrounded, with four teams against them (taking into account man-army Bellamy on the inside, who is supposed to get the caged Grounders on his side). Both groups will try to do anything but anything for theirs, and save their lives. It does for good TV, and as said above, for a strange twist, that, nonetheless, makes sense. The atmosphere is great, the action restless, and the characters all have their moments.It's uneven, and rushed, but not a bad episode. It's surprising, and gut-wrenching, and nail-biting, that's for sure, and that makes for any shortcomings it may have."

Mount Weather people won't stop at nothing to get back to the ground and the Ark people the same to stop them.There're no good people.That a character has to remember us this is unnecessary, but forgivable. Shows tend to self-reference and talk too much.But that's the only problem one can find with this last episode of season two. If you leave Jaha's search for god on the side (full of surprises, and a terrible outcome most probably), this last episode has everything that a show may desire. The Ark people are afraid for their own, but the Mount Weather people can't wait anymore, won't wait anymore. Everyone becomes blind but for their own desires and motives. It makes for great moments, as you can see characters (as Kane) trying to dialogue, and the other side making the three-monkeys thing. It's very real and very human, as has been studied that people react with their most basic instincts to the need to survive. Clarke and Bellamy (they really act as a team, even if everyone seems to believe Clarke is the leader)'s decisions are justified, not by long discourses, but by situations, actions, consequences. But everyone else's too (Lincoln, Octavia, who has some great moments, Monty, Maya...). Even if the viewer doesn't agree with what happens, they won't be able to say that the show doesn't explain why they do what they do. Everything keeps being dark, bleak and hopeless, with little chance that sunny and bright days are to come.And now, about that crazy Jaha..."

I enjoyed seeing how 3 months forward has changed our favorite characters. The actors are as talented and convincing as I remembered from season 2. An awesome cast, captivating story, and a thrilling new world awaits anyone who watches season 3. I can't wait to find out what Jason Rothenberg has in store for the rest of the season!

After the last bit of the show, I couldn't stop saying ""oh my gosh, that was SOOO good""! Right now i'm just like, a lot of information just exploded inside my brain with so many emotions running through my head! Too many feels!

","Very solid plot with good characters introduced, appropriate to the story. The plot is not predictable, and clearly shows this remains a sleeper series. Unfortunately, despite Mad Max making it as a movie to the academy awards, the 100 is still not receiving 1/8th of its fair share. This episode leaves us having to immediately move onto the next one. The introduction of the new character is carefully done so as to leave the audience in suspense of the value or role they may play next. Solid writing. The only limits, however are having to go back to season 2 in order to recall some of Clarke's actual activities that are referred to in the first few episodes. That often happens even in the best series that are Emmy winners."

105,32,6,0," Good show with a lot bad character decisions
","The series have a one huge problem, lack of consistency in characters decisions. This episode shows it painfully. Bellamy decision is contradiction to what he did and worked for in last twenty episodes, betrayal to his sister and Lincoln and his tribe, Clarke and actually everyone who trusted him. Things like that are just annoying. But we saw it already too many times in the show. From criminal and anarchist who doesn't care about anyone but himself to reasonable leader when it comes to Bellamy. From reasonable leader to a religious fanatic like Thelonius. From selfless pacifist to a cold blooded murderer in case of Finn and from egoistical killer and maniac to helpful team member and voice of reason in case of John Murphy, from power hungry, ruthless security officer to a sensible diplomat - Kane. It really becomes very annoying in longer term i do know people change but does they really change so often and so drastically? From the beginning of the show i have a feeling that producers didn't hired enough actors. All of plot shifts and surprises they have for us would be a lot more reasonable if they used twice as many people to introduce them. Instead they are using the same characters to do things that are completely contrary for them. And this episode is painful reminder. Bellamy actions are complete contradicion to his character but could fit another member of original hundred that we didn't had too many chances to know yet, resulting with the same outcome. Everything would be reasonable and well written then. Now it's just another bad plot twist and character change that doesn't make any sense especially that his action should most probably get Clarke killed, alienate Octavia forever (maybe even result in her death if she choose to eg. warn Grounders and/or escape with Lincoln) and result in hundreds other deaths, Sky Crew also. Whole scenario from the beginning is full of such bad character changes and i have strong feeling that script was written for a lot of more characters but it's played by very limited actor crew. In the end i have a theory that original scripts included more characters that take lead roles in various episodes and maybe die along the way or goes into backstage for some time (just as Game of Thrones and Walking Dead were not afraid to kill their characters), but instead producers decided that audience already like first crew so they shouldn't do any bold moves with the show and rewritten the script to save all twists but performed by half of the planned crew. Bad decision."

Actually there were quite a lot of interesting moments, and normally it could have been a good episode.But there were a few things that makes me want to just let go of this show. The unbelievable criminal idiocy of some of the characters and their unreasonable decisions is just too annoying and irritating. It's hard to imagine someone to be so moronic as some of them. Which makes it clear that those stupid decisions they make were just to push the plot ahead.Like i said, not everything in this episode is bad, but still i give it one star. because this episode is making me not wanting to watch the show anymore, and this is the worst thing that an episode of a show can do."

Although her intentions are noble, I have feeling this isn't the last time we hear Emerson's name.To be blunt, I never did like Jaha and Alie's storyline. However I do like the direction there story is headed, the mystery that lies beneath Alie's codes and why it is so important that she finds it. On the other hand, Titus isn't the warm hearted and kindred spirit that we thought, As he savagely beats the info about the pill out of Murphy. Which leads me to ask: hasn't this guy been through enough?"
112,34,7,0," Hungry
","This sixth episode develops a little bit more the three story lines of the season. We have Clarke getting a nice present in the form of the last survivor of Mount Weather, mister Emerson, Jaha & Alie's secret plan and last, but not least, Pike's desire to make Arkadia a superpower. In general, it delivers in all three of them, but at the same time, doesn't advance the story much.On the first plot development, it's nice to see how the show continues with some interesting questions. Clarke wants Emerson to suffer for his actions, but after her convincing Lexa of forgiving the massacre done by the Ark-people to the Grounders, will she think just of revenge or will she see the bigger picture? It's always harder to think when something/someone is close to us, and the writers and Eliza Taylor do a good job of showing a person unsure of the next step.Jaha & Alie's plan is the part that probably gets more screen time. If it wasn't clear enough that Alie and the City of Light were bad news, the episode gives more information about what they are planning while keeping a lot of information still hidden, making the viewer wonder about all the tidbits that ""The 100"" is feeding.Pike's crazy plan gets the action-part of the episode. Pike and his followers decide to take one Grounder region for them with unexpected consequences. Bob Morley's Bellamy seems to have regressed as a character, though, which is a pity, as he was bringing some interesting nuances to the character. Now he has become more white&black. Probably in future episodes we will see more gray, not just from him but from others too.All in all, good, but not great episode. Alie and the new tensions with the Grounders are still not as interesting as the Mount Weather threat."
113,35,9,1," Outstanding writing, surprises
","Wow! This one has an incredibly magnetic plot, pulling the viewer in so emotionally deep, and has such the classic surprise climax that captures the audience with a gasp. While my reviews are vague, because I leave out the spoilers, I must say too many user reviews are sadly written by those based upon emotional bias, and this episode, while one of the best written/acted in the series, is not receiving the high marks due to such user politically charged bias. Suffice to say, this episode combines multiple genres within the story that a truly great group of writers, actors, directors and producers can achieve: sci fi, drama, love, action/adventure and politics (if we even consider that a genre). Excellent episode, and core transition subtle to the rest of the season."
114,35,10,1," I expected a bad episode given the reviews

Amazing development to the story (what really matters).I'm hyped for what's next!"
115,35,10,1," This episode makes me want to read the book!
","This was hands down the best episode of the entire series. The story just keeps getting better! We finally get to move on from a simple, time hogging character to explore the other complexities of the show. At the same time, the show does a great job keeping it's viewership up by replacing angry ""only here for sociopolitical reasons"" ones with ""intrigued by the story and content"" ones.I almost never rate specific episodes of shows unless they really move me. Which is why I was horrified to find that this episode has a 4.8 rating. I'm not calling out the whole lgbt community, because that would be as absurd as calling out every supporter of a certain presidential campaign. However, there is an overwhelming presence of hateful, uptight, paranoid users who have proclaimed LGBTHAD against this show under false pretense. And it is embarrassing to the human race."
116,35,9,1," Despite the reviews, great episode
","Despite what you may see from these reviews, this was in fact a very good episode. If you follow the actors you would see that Alicia is indeed (and this may come as a shock to some) a GUEST STAR. Yes you guessed right! She is a guest star and her character is subject to removal at any time. This show is set in a post apocalyptic world and it was bound to happen sooner or later, if not in this episode than the season finale. It was stated plenty of times that Alicia was having scheduling difficulties because of the fact that she is a lead character on another show (Fear of the Walking Dead). Trust me, I loved Lexa as a character! I did at times question why she had more screen time than some of the lead characters but I guess these things happen sometimes. The progression of this season, at times questionable, does not negate the fact that this show is indeed a good one."

","What are ypu doing? Dind't you understand anythinng about this series? Are you really care if the most charismatic character have gone? It's nothing. The 100 has a storyline to be followed. You are behaving like the children of the first episode. My evaluation for it is 9.5. And i~m being pessimist. It values more than it.It's clear for me that the story has a particular modal that will take us for a unthinkable dystopic. I predicated that, artificial and robotic intelligence in my book, but nothing like this universe.. It's important to think about that, the new universe with both inteligences is a new reallity.My book is Condao, just in Portuguese. You can find in skoob"

","After the surprising plot development of the previous episode, ""The 100"" keeps the tension and the stakes high, and offers another great episode.We are back at Arkadia, where things are going bad fast. Pike is obsessed with the ""us"" Vs. ""them"" and is bringing everyone down with him. There is a nice dialogue were Kane brings up the issue of distrust and fear that is becoming generalized in Arkadia, and how Pike's view of things is turning people against each other.But the episode offers much more than just people having conversations, even if they are quite interesting ones. It is also an action packed episode, with everyone hiding something, and everyone trying to push their own agenda, in a subtle or obvious manner. And Bellamy's character is once again developed in interesting ways.If the ""us"" Vs. ""them"" wasn't enough, we also have some interesting new tidbits about Alie's plan, and a very good moment with Raven.""Terms and Conditions"" is an amazing episode, and one of the best of ""The 100"", leaving things in place for a, what seems it's going to be, a very interesting second part of the season 3."
119,36,9,1," Don't believe the negative reviews, people are still mad from last week's problems.

Everyone is entitled to their opinion, but I checked myself and a lot of the reviews are from members who just made an account this week; just to attack the show with bad reviews. I personally loved this episode, and I love the direction they are going with the A.I. and messing with Raven's memories. Pike is also a good villain for this season,because you understand where he's coming from, and sometimes he even sounds right. It's interesting how things will be played out. The tone has remained the same in the show, don't let one mishap effect your perspective of the show from now on."

","This was a pretty good episode, people are rating badly because there salty because of what happened last week, overall the episode is well structured and interesting keeps your attention and you don't know what's going to happen next, it like a battle through in tell it was a very different episode than what they have done in the past, but very well done. The episode contains to people on opposite sides of the same fight trying to work there way to get rid of the other while others try to stop them both and one is more ruthless than the other, it seems these too are playing a game of chess and everyone else is just there pawns."
121,36,2,0," So boring, so pointless...I fell asleep
","Easily one of the worst episodes of the series. More of the contrived Arkadia plot line where character motivation, logic, and any semblance of intelligence is completely absent. Pike continues to be a one-note caricature villain, Hannah a sociopath, Bellamy a brainless sheep, Monty inexplicably going along. To be honest, they could bombard Arkadia and I would not miss most of the characters (I would save only Raven, Abby and Kane). Ship them off to Polis with Octavia and Lincoln, revive Lexa, have Clarke shampoo her hair and lets all just forget about this other nonsense. None of the delinquents aside from these mentioned are captivating enough to have a lot of screen time.As for the City of Light, Becca made it compelling with the flashbacks but I heard that will be the only one, so we are stuck with Jaha pontificating from now on again....and I find that barely watchable. Season 3 is a disaster."

","The commander's death last week was filled with plot holes and lazy writing. It would seem that killing the commander has effectively killed any interest i still had in this show. The virtual reality storyline could be interesting but the way they chose to connect it with the Polis storyline was just lazy writing. I was very disappointed indeed. The episode this week was just plain boring. Whoever made the decision to feature an episode without Clarke, Octavia and of course Lexa made a grave mistake in my opinion. At this point this show should be canceled. Which is sad because I find most of the actors very talented and would love to continue watching for them but the storyline is just too boring and the overall plot filled with holes. I hope the actors go on to do more amazing things and leave this sad excuse of a show behind."

For so long I have stated that raven is one of the strongest charters in this show and she defies time and time again the misguided quote that love is weakness. Love is what made Raven capable of breaking away from ALIE's hold, it is what brought her back. Definitely an amazing episode for her. Also the banter between Jasper and raven played out incredibly well.We also had the first kiss between a biracial M|M couple, which is always great!The episode was dominated by the POC of the show which is a welcome change from the last few episodes.Once again Bob Morley's acting was impeccable and you could see in his eyes the moment that bellamy switched back to the right side.

This brings quite a mixture of feelings in my head, ranging from LOL to desperation. Since when the forums started deciding how will a TV show plot continue? Enough!This episode was a turn back to the reality. Some innovative ideas were born too early and died. Some peace talkers will have to wage their own wars now. Old promises have been fulfilled, new have been given. This episode is so true to the world of The 100 that I would really like to give it 10/10, but 9/10 is more realistic. Life happens."

","If in previous episodes we had had the action centered on Arkadia or on the 12 tribes, in this episode we get a little bit of both. And the better for it.For starters, after Lexa's death, there is the little problem of succession, and what is going to happen when a new leader rises to power. Is it going to be one that thinks the Arkadia people are ones you can negotiate with, or is it one that believes the ""lay waste to your enemies"" is a great motto to start your day with? Even if it is pretty easy to see where the episode is going, it is nicely done, and the action and tension are high.On the other side, not willing to be looked down, Kane's coup and punishment conundrum. We have Pike getting madder and madder, and Bellamy starting to think that now, that his own people are taking the brunt of the tensions, things should change. It is Bellamy being at his most Bellamy: naive, not much constructive thinking, and act before recognizing that maybe thinking is not a bad idea. Is Kane going to be killed? And also the ones that were in with him? The episode keeps us on the edge, and the outcome is, maybe not surprising for some, but not something that can be seen from a mile away, and shocking.Good episode overall, and things happening non-stop."

It was powerful and to me is showing the development of the characters and the atmosphere. Moreover, why are people crying like little pathetic babies like ""omg!

In addition it seems everyone is playing the race card or sexual orientation card... ""omg! killed of a lesbian! This is sooooo bad!"" Oh OK. See, I was under the impression that Lexa was 1000x more of a person and character then just being a bloody lesbian.... But no. tragic people nowadays don't see her as a critical character and that her death is very important both in general and for the development of the story. No. All they see is ""omg. they killed a lesbian. omg. this is the worst ever. omg. omg."" Christ save us..... Same thing with Lincoln too. ""omg. they killed that coloured guy. omg. 1000000% racist. omg. this is horrible. omg. 1 star. omg."" That all that goes on in their heads instead of seeing the importance of it both symbolically and for how the story will develop and how it's going to affect the other characters etc. Just pure ignorance.A lot of things were laid out in this one and a lot of interesting things happened and it deserves a solid 8.7 in my opinion."

Monty is trying to get with the rebels, and Kane is planning on getting Pike and giving him to the Grounders.The plot of this episode is heavy on shock and violence, something that ""The 100"" has been offering on spades since the beginning. There are for sure a couple of moments that will come out of the blue, and one of them is going to have huge consequences. That the show keeps walking this thin line without jumping the shark is amazing. It is a little bit slow (the peace goes up close to the end) but it is grim, very grim. Are the characters going to be able to rise to the occasion? Has Bellamy any chance at redemption? What is going to happen to Raven?The show has had many things going on this third season, even too many. Characters have died, relationships coming and going, distrust, betray, coups...

There was so much anger and hurt, Octavia wanting to leave, Allie/Raven trying to further her agenda and calling out the characters' weaknesses, Monty having to face something he might not recover from. However, while things are falling apart, it finally feels like everything's coming together. The story is moving forward again and the parallels, of which there was no shortage, brought meaning and emotion to an overall incredible episode. The acting deserves to be mentioned as well, since Devon, Chris, Bob and Eliza have all become parts of their roles and portray their characters beautifully. Lindsey Morgan, however, was the scene- stealer and perhaps deserves the most praise for giving a powerful, yet touchingly vulnerable performance."
134,39,10,1," the 100 is back
","The only episode (well, aside from the season premiere) that made me feel that it's finally back.I'm delighted by the delinquents being back and working together to save their friend. The fact that almost all of them were given more focus and conflict (and ultimately, resolution) in this one episode than the entire 3A was refreshing. Of course, my criticisms to this show/season aside, I still enjoyed this episode and it made me remember why I loved this show in the first place.A shout out to Lindsey Morgan's performance, too. Fans have been craving for Raven to be given the spotlight she so deserves. They managed to do so in this episode and my, it was glorious."
135,39,10,1," back to its roots
","I loved this episode because the whole gang was back together. It felt like the 100 again. The characters interactions were vulnerable, and caring. So fulfilling to see some of these characters who were apart for so long interact again. Paired with this great story, it all fit really well together. It was even a bottle episode which are never the best but this episode WAS SO GOOD. I was on the edge of my seat. My roommate could hear me gasp and say ""aww"" so much was happening. Really enjoyed the episode. Morgan's performance this episode was crazy good. This episode really displays what a range she has in acting. Really impressed. My roommate could hear me gasp and say ""aww"" so much was happening. Really enjoyed the episode."
136,39,10,1," Our delinquents attempt to save their friend Raven from the clutches of ALIE
",THis episode focuses on our main characters attempting to save Raven from the clutches of ALIE and the City of Light. This episode reunites our main characters with the sole focus of saving Raven. Emotional angst and rehashing of old wounds ensues. ALIE is in the background and sufficiently creepy. A nod to the Borg from star trek TNG. It will keep you on the edge of your seat and will run you through the gamut of emotions. The acting in this episode is completely on point and a nod is given to at least 2 famous cult movie. It is by far the best episode to date. At the end of the episode our main characters have a new goal. Don't listen to the haters this is a do not miss episode!
137,39,10,1," The 100 is back to its roots.
","Before I start my recap I wanted the causal viewers tell something. The reason for this episode and every episode since 307 has such a low rating is just the reaction of immature people who can not deal with the fact that fictional characters die on TV shows and now try to get the show canceled and look bad. Just in case you are wondering why a TV Show which episodes are usually rated with 8-9 stars drop to 5 within a week. The show is not getting worse - its quite the opposite: its getting better again. What brings me back to my intention. And bringing back is exactly what happened this episode. ""Nevermore"" is full of Season 1 vibes. We got the delinquents working together, no Arkardia, no Polis - just our heroes. We got back our dream-leadership- team Bellamy and Clarke. With this episode we go back to the roots of the 100. The core of yesterday's episode was the 100 - working and survival together. It was excellent. Lindsay Morgan killed it. Her performance was outstanding. Bob Morley could stay silent the entire episode and yet we would know and feel what Bellamy feels and wants to say. Eliza Taylor and the rest of the crew were also incredible. Best episode of S3 so far."
138,39,10,1," Excellent Episode
",One of the best episodes so far this season. Lindsey Morgan is one of the best actresses on the show. I'm also glad to see Clarke back with her friends instead of being stuck in Polis with Lexa who thankfully is no longer in the show.After episode 7 the show has began to really get started and we are seeing some action. Ignore the 1 star ratings they are just some butt hurt fans who are purposely rating the show low.The Alli SL as well the commander back story's have all come together and the Pike SL is almost ready to conclude. This season is quite different from previous ones.
139,39,10,1," Amazing Episode! Star of the Episode: Lindsey Morgan
","I think this episode was amazing!! Lindsey's performance was Emmy worthy! So good! Don't know why so many people are rating it down just because of the Clarke and Bellamy relation... Many people are being petty just because their favourite ship didn't last, and they're not recognizing the fact that this episode was the first big Raven focused episode, and Lindsey did a mind blowing job. Other than that, I think the character developments are going great for the other delinquents; as you can tell from how their behaviours have changed since the beginning of the series. So ignoring all the haters, I say Good Job writers and most of all: Lindsey you've just gained a devoted fan!"
140,39,10,1," This has been the best episode for awhile
","I am just so happy that all of the delinquents are back together. I am pretty upset that Monty has to kill his mom though, but someone had to do it. This might make him develop more.I feel extremely bad for Bellamy, yes he did do a lot of stupid things, but he feels bad about them obviously. He cant change what he did. Everyone has done stupid things some more then others. He should have gotten a talk maybe to see what he did was wrong. but he did by Niylah and she might even say more about it next week. Who knows? All I know is he will get better and see that what he did was wrong and he needs a change in character.Lindsey Morgan did a great job she should be extremely proud of her performance. She is literally so great. I hope she doesn't get that hurt anytime soon or at all.At least Octavia sees that she does have people around that she works well with. Jasper is finally getting over his rut I think. This episode was great and nothing anyone can say will change my opinions. I keep watching the show because I love it and the actors. Next week I bet the episode will be as god as this one, I hope."
141,39,10,1," Best Episode of the Season (Tho That's Not a High Bar...)
","This season has been rough, inconsistent, gratuitous, rushed, and written fine at best. I've honestly been debating dropping the show-- the only thing that has kept me going is a couple characters, Raven included. This episode made me think there might be hope for the last couple episodes of this mess. The 100 is definitely strongest when the core characters are together, using their unique talents to solve a problem. Lindsey Morgan was incredible in this episode, and I couldn't be more proud of her and the rest of the cast. There were even some jokes in this episode, which I've sorely missed this season. Honestly, I enjoyed it. I hope I can continue to enjoy this show which is near and dear to my heart."
142,40,10,1," Captivating and Heart Clinching
","Great episode, captures the growth of the characters on a totally different level. Does not just focus on Clarke the whole episode though which is what makes it amazing. Although Clarke is the main character and in a huge portion of this episode, it does get tiring to only see her and not many other characters. So I am glad Bellamy, others get a chance to shine and for their character to develop. I totally don't see all the negative reviews for this show. It seems like they are all just because they killed off Lexa a couple episodes ago. Shame that people still aren't over it. The only thing I don't really get is the ""maybe there are no heroes"" theme."
143,40,10,1," The 100 is BACK
","This was a great episode. The 100 are for real back together now--including Raven! The key to the 100's appeal is the characters, and the characters shine best when they're together. This episode feels like we're returning to what the show's success was based on. In terms of the episode specifically, the writers tried to add a bit of a horror theme to this one. But the real appeal is the character scenes. Some excellent moments for Bellarke fans (whether you ship them or just ship them platonically) and some touching moments for Jasper, Octavia and for Raven. Surprising developments on the Murphy front back in Polis. We can start to finally be really excited about the direction the show is going this season. Can't wait until next week!"
144,40,7,0," Entertaining filler
","After saving Raven, the group heads back to Arkadia, where an unexpected enemy is waiting for them. At the same time, Murphy meets an old friend with unexpected consequences.This episode of ""The 100"" doesn't advance much the story, and it is more a filler than anything else, even though it has a couple of very important/touching moments. The group working together again is a nice touch, but the story for the episode is not a especially interesting one, as the group has to face an ""unknown"" enemy who seems to be picking them one by one.As it plays, the episode seems a homage to horror movies about monsters lurking in the dark, with characters getting picked up one by one. It is entertaining though, as the action and the tension are nicely done, but it is not something you have not seen countless of times on movies or TV series. If not for the characters the viewer has come to care about, it would be a run-of-the-mill kind of episode, competently done, but nothing more."
145,40,7,0," Weird.
",This episode is weird. Not much happens. Story barely progress. There are pointless plotpoint that we don't know what is it for.
146,41,10,1," The 100 is an amazing show!
","To all the butt hurt Lexa fans, please stop rating the episodes with one star. No amount of disrespect and hatred can bring her back to life, so get a life and move on. Seriously, it's extremely disheartening for the writers to see a bunch of one stars, and it isn't going to make them feel sympathy for you. Rather, it damages your bad reputation even further. Don't watch the show anymore if your favorite character dies, fine, but don't spread the hate to others. It's not cool, and I'm pretty sure you only have the guts to say those nasty comments because you're protected by a computer screen. Thank you, and have a nice day."
147,41,1,0," Misses the Mark
","The 100 once again delivers poorly constructed allusions to Christianity, mixed in with a bastardization of plot lines and scenes already done by Game of Thrones, along with attempts at emotional character redemption that fall flat and rushed on multiple accounts. The attempt to get a typical teen drama from the CW into the ""Big Leagues"" of emotionally devastating and engaging TV dramas like GOT and The Walking Dead is admirable, and might work, if the writers recognized what is and what isn't appropriate in terms of the pacing and overall construction of story arcs. All that's been building up could have been lovely storytelling had crucial factors such as character development and continuity factored into the decision making process of recent episodes. Overall, another disappointing episode that had potential to be great if the developments made had felt organic rather than manufactured."
148,41,10,1," A perfect episode
","The 100 continues time and again to deliver quality television. The acting is great and the story is top notch. The writing and pacing have improved significantly in the second half of season 3. This show is not intended for children or immature people. It has strong adult themes that are best viewed by mature adults who are capable of separating fantasy from reality. ""Join or Die"" was filled with excellent cinematic choices and a strong forward motion in the plot. The focus on the delinquents is always the most successful path for The 100 writers and this episode was no exception. Bravo to the writers and creative team for The 100. You are doing great work."
149,41,10,1," To the Producers and the Directors
","I've been watching The 100 ever since the first Season. Over the years The 100 has become different, it has evolved to target a larger audience, it just feels a bit different. I don't mind the mass genocide of the cast, change is necessary for the survival of this franchise. I don't mind if you kill Heda, she needs to move aside for the story to continue, I've learned that when Finn had to die.This episode gave me old memories and returned me to the universe of The 100, I believe the music at the end did this, but also the flashbacks, either way, I would hope the producers and the directors would go back to target my audience as they did in season 1. Thanks, I'm a boy, 21 years old."
150,41,8,1," Is there any chance of survival?
","""The 100"" is reaching its third season climax and it is doing it with another great episode, with great action, good plot developments and so many things and so interesting happening that there's not a moment respite. On the down side, a couple of plot developments are not very original, but being as good as this episode is, it can be forgiven.Clarke, Bellamy, Octavia and Jasper are on a mission to find Luna. Murphy gets a nice visit from Pike, with unexpected consequences. And Kane... well, Kane has problems of his own.All three story-lines are nicely done, with good acting, action, tension and surprises. Probably Kane's the weakest, even if Cusick keeps the character being one of the most interesting of the show. Murphy, Pike and Indra's prison meeting seems to be telling the viewer: antagonistic-enemies-will-become-partners, but is another good moment for the show, with visceral feelings. Clarke's and company mission is quite interesting too, and it makes you wonder more and more about what the show can keep offering. It seems getting Luna's help won't be as easy as they expected.It is actually amazing how ""The 100"" keeps developing characters, fresh story-lines and engrossing moments.But can they stop the City of Light dwellers? Or is it just too late?"
151,41,8,1," Back on track
",This is the first OK episode after a long time! Hope they'll keep it that way
152,41,8,1," I enjoy it but it looks really messed up.

153,42,10,1," Phenomenal
","The 100 is, and continues to be the best show currently on TV. This show has gotten a lot of unwarranted hate for the last couple months from angry fanboys who completely missed the point on this show. If you hate The 100 so much, then just stop watching it and don't try and ruin it for the rest of us who enjoy the shows, or others that are trying to get into it.This episode was riveting, and is a nice build up for the two-part season finale! Cannot wait!If you have never watched The 100, then you need to! Best show on TV right now, and definitely top 3 sci fi show of ALL TIME!"
154,42,1,0," 99 problems and the 100 won't be one
","And this whole episode was one. Why did the boat kru speak English when Lincoln specifically mentioned in s1 that they do not speak it? Why was Clarke practically forcing the chip on to Luna? Oh, wait, I remember ‚Äì because this is the same show that thought that scene between Murphy and Ontari was okay. Because this is the showrunner that forsakes good writing to be 'dark and edgy,' and ugh this whole thing has become such a mess, why do I even put my faith in it maybe redeeming itself? The show had all the ingredients to be something great, and now nothing of that is left. Clarke has been reduced to an emotional punching bag for a bunch of self-absorbed whining assholes that expect her to clean up after them even when they use her as a collective target to shove their guilt on. All she does is apologize and take the blame. It's disheartening to watch Clarke, my favorite character ever - to be reduced to that, so I'm bowing out. Lost me."
155,42,7,0," Many things still on the air
","""The 100"" is close to the end of the season, but there are so many things still in the air, that it will be interesting to see what it has to offer in the last two episodes.Clarke and her team are in the oil platform, with Luna and her people. They will try to convince her, but can they? Raven and Monty discover something quite interesting while in Arkadia. And Murphy, Indra and Pike join forces to try to break free from their prison.This is another solid episode, even if it leaves more things unanswered than anything else. It advances the story in quite a neat manner, and there are a couple of situations and conversations that hint to many more things happening that what the show has been letting the viewer know. Is there someone we still don't know of that has joined Alie's army? There are probably a couple of surprises waiting before the end of the season (and maybe more unexpected deaths?). Nonetheless, so close to the end of the season and so high stakes, makes the viewer wonder if they will be able to deal with Alie and its City of Light before it is too late. Will this story be still going on next season or will they have something new as they have had in each of the previous seasons?As always the actors do a good job, nice character and plot development, and the atmosphere as grim as ever. There is a moment when the show, again, stretches a situation just to bring more tension to it than necessary in a too obvious manner, something the shows falls into more than it should.But ""The 100"" keeps being one of the most ambiguous and interesting shows on TV right now."
156,42,10,1," Wow
",I just cant belive what im watching on season 3. Its litteraly the best thing i have watched since GOT at its best. Ppl can rate it low whatever they want but for me its one of the best shows ever and this episode was insane.

158,43,9,1," Preparing for an epic finale
","Well long story short...the episode was great!! That's what the 100 does; that is to keep you on the edge, to never know what will happen, to challenge you emotionally, to hold you tight on your seat till the very end. Personally I believe that the story line of season 3 was by far the best out of all seasons. It had everything; twisted plot, love, deaths; it challenged/tested the limits of friendship, honor ship and morality versus survival. I was never more excited for a series like I am with the 100...simple because 1)is freaking unpredictable till the very end, 2) its stellar performances, 3)the depth of the points that the series is illustrating, 4) its fast pace."
159,43,8,1," A great start to the two-part end of the season
","After failing in getting Luna's help, the group decides that the only option they have is to take Ontari and free her from Alie before giving her the flame. But before they get on with their mission, they receive the unexpected help of Roan, who then decides to join them.This is a very solid episode for ""The 100"", dark, gritty, violent and desperate. The group free from Alie (Clarke, Octavia, Bellamy...) don't have many options, so they decide for a suicide mission. The plot is brilliantly developed, fully of surprises, unexpected turns and difficult decisions for the characters. Very difficult decisions. That the actors pull all this off with credibility is a sign of the good work and chemistry all of them have on screen. And it just gets better and better as the episode continues, hinting at a very interesting showdown for the finale."
160,43,8,1," This is fun.
",I enjoy this episode. The story is intense and thrilling. Gives us finale vibes and ends with question. It is interesting though how all these characters try to find solutions to the problem they faces.
161,43,10,1," I'm Still Hooked !
","Again I'm addressing the 1/10's Campaign. - I dunno. You know those negative ""wounded"" people who always have that ""Us Against the World"" mentality who always find a way to make it about somebody being ""oppressed"" ? I think maybe THAT'S what infected the user rating platform.For example ---> ""It's especially gross when (the tortured) are only bisexual characters (or even any other minority character for that matter, which it ALWAYS is lets be real) that the writers take so much pride in being ""so progressive"" for.""
Then they talk about how Clarke was supposed to represent the BISEXUAL community, but if these LGBT and minority characters are always going to be mistreated {by the writers}, then they'd rather have NO representation at all.Awwww. Are you serious ? Really ? I'm blown away that so many so-called fans have made this show about societal social agendas. I get that certain people groups have been mistreated in life, gone through painful stuff, and yearn to have gratifying representation on television that they can identify with. That's understandable. But all this ""lashing out"" and attacking of a TV SHOW'S creator, storyline choices, and writers, is just a really bad look, not to mention immature, unfair, and IMAGINARY.
-----> ""The writers have to get off of their high horse and stop queer baiting.""I'm starting to comprehend what's happened here. When word got around that the ""The 100"" had strong Bi/Homo-sexual or minority lead characters or side plots, those groups ""rallied"" around the show, tuned in, supported it, and became invested in their story arcs. They were figuratively ""rejoicing"" for a ""win for our team"". They were happy they finally had characters on-screen they desired to identify with and fall in love with. THEN, when the story arcs and character developments didn't conform to THEIR ideas or meet THEIR expectations, they felt BETRAYED and lashed out in the manner they are accustomed to. Hmmmm.Does that sound pretty accurate or plausible ? I don't know what to say except that's what you get when you make TV SHOWS about something more than just SIMPLE entertainment. Thankfully, The 100 survived the ""Assault of the Scorned"" fanbase exodus and has moved on for 3 more Seasons and likely a 4th (depending how this Season 6 goes).Perhaps the writers ""got off their high horses and stopped queer baiting"" to achieve continued success. Perhaps they ARE aware of the IMDB controversy that was had Season 3. Perhaps ""Perverse Instantiation"" has a double meaning signaling the lessons that the writers learned in Season 3. I'll be starting Season 4 tomorrow. Peace."
162,44,1,0," A lame conclusion to a crappy season
","Love that Lexa was back at least for a while, but the show has become a parody of itself. The plot is messy and the story line is simply convoluted. There is no development nor answers. It was obvious how the episode was overly edited after shooting. It didn't feel like a finale. Bellamy's attempt for redemption is too rushed and honestly absurd at this point since he was looking for a way to forgive himself when he never really accepted the consequences of his actions or admitted that they were wrong. Not surprise that Clarke and Raven were the only ones left alone, in pain and grieving. This show is not progressive as it pretends to be. It is poorly written and stereotypical. In simple words: Not worth watching."
163,44,1,0," What even
","******** SPOILERS***************So the Kill Switch was an actual switch. I'm not even kidding.The chipped people climbed the outside of the tower? Basically a bad zombie movie flashback. Ontari was reduced to a blood bag. Oh, and then Abby had split her chest open and massage her heart because being reduced to a blood bag was just not powerful enough. Wow. Jasper ate an ice cream cone. This isn't the most ridiculous thing about the City Of Light, but it comes pretty close.Lexa is back, but then she sacrifices herself to an angry mob for Clarke. I would say this is the only not-crappy part of the episode, if it didn't have the ""trying to fix the lesbian-killed-by-a-stray-bullet trope a little too late"" all over it.I've seen a lot or TV show rock bottoms but this one takes the cake."
164,44,8,1," The story looks messed up but ok.
","The story here is really messed up. But I like it. The character's development is weird. The conclusion is pretty neat, though the director should give the characters more time to relief and more time for the ending. In fact, the ending is pretty sucks. They could do it better."

","I've watched from the beginning and this show has been amazing. I hope the show can continue because we are lacking good sci Fy shows at this time. This type of story leaves a lot of room for the writers, I just hope they continue to develop the story line to keep it going for seasons to come."

","I'm so so so so happy that this show I fell in love with is back in full force. The Season 4 premiere was amazing and everything else for Season 4 looks just as amazing. Incredibly talented cast, great storyline, amazing relationship/character moments, and more! Feels like the season true fans of the show have been waiting for.It's only going to get better from here! I highly encourage people to stick with this show to see Season 4. It totally pays off. There were so many moments that I loved and, after the more painful moments of Season 3, it was soooo worth the wait.I think the endgame the writers are working towards is going to be epic and emotional and everything that makes a great story."

","I love the 100 with all my heart, i feel like the characters are amazing, i love the premise and absolutely adored season 1 and 2, but season 3 was mess. I still enjoyed it but it was really ridiculous what has happened with the storyline, i felt that what they did with bellamy was unnecessary and done ""just because"", lexa's death was so badly planned that made me angry. Didn't care for allie or the whole artificial intelligence deal. I felt as if they were trying soo hard to make the show dark and unpredictable that it ended up a mess. I was really worried for season 4. I wanted to see a bit of lightheartedness while still approaching serious subjects. I wanted to see my favourite characters acting like themselves and most of all i want a storyline that was actually worthy of the 100, and thank god, i think they got it. It's hard to tell from one episode but i loved it. I thought it was serious but it gave you this sense of hope and joy that made you root for these characters success in saving the world. It had a bit of jokes,and I felt like Bellamy and Clarke were finally in character, especially loved Bellamy in this one. I feel like this season will finally go back to the 100 roots and will make me love this show again as much as before. Overall i can't wait for the next of the season."
168,45,7,0," We are back, and there is no hope for us
","The fourth season of ""The 100"" starts in a slow fashion, giving closure to a couple of story-lines while introducing some of the ideas that will dominate throughout the remainder of the season.We left our heroes with something of a conundrum: the City of Light was finished, but the aftermath of it was not. Roan is more dead than alive, Clarke and Bellamy have to decide what to do with the information they got from the A.I., the Skaikru have not many friends left on the ground...The episode does a good job in bringing the viewer back to the story. All the characters we have get to know and care for get some screen time, and even get some character development (Jasper, for example) that you many not expect in an introduction to a new season. All the moody atmosphere and sense of desperation is back, and the violence and fear too. On the other hand, the episode suffers a little bit in its pace, the first minutes a little bit slow as it tries to help the viewer remember how we got there.With a new threat, one that seems insurmountable, ""The 100"" has all the tools it needs for some very exciting new episodes."
169,45,7,0," Back to not giving Clarke a break.
","I was genuinely scared of this episode. I expected it to be not as bad as season 3 overall, but still not really that good as THE 100 has once been. And yes, I liked Lexa, yes, I was sad that she died, no, that's not the only reason I didn't like season 3. For example, Bellamy's story line was just unnecessary and unbelievable to me. I hated how they introduced a girlfriend that we never even seen before, that there was no build-up to, no chemistry, nothing... But we are supposed to believe that when she dies, he'll be as mad as he would be if Octavia died? Sorry, that's a no. Him joining Pike and killing all the grounders... That was no character development, that was just Bellamy from season 1. And I didn't like it. The whole A.L.I.E. story line sucked as well. A show about survival suddenly became this sci-fi show about artificial intelligence? I'm sorry. But What? Why? How? Who? When? Where?But this review shouldn't be about season 3 so I stop it here. It seems like the show runners still don't want Clarke to catch a break, since everybody is hating on her yet again even though it's not her fault at all (Seems like season 3 again?) Not really something new in that regard. Octavia is bad ass as ever, though everybody seems to be suddenly concerned of her because she killed a guy she absolutely hated... That's something she never did before, right? The story line of the first episode wasn't really a lot more than the story lines of season 1 and 2 combined. Skikru against everybody else basically for the same f*****g reasons... And yet, it seems like we could get something new in the next episodes, which I'm definitely looking forward to. But let's just hope that we'll never see an awkward sex scene like the one in this episode ever again.Don't get me wrong though, I still really enjoyed this one, hence the 7/10. But the repetition is definitely acknowledgable."
170,45,8,1," Good start.
","The 100 is back and it comes with good plot, story. The direction of the show is interesting. The story is progressing fast. Setting up for this season."
171,46,8,1," It seems like it's starting to get better.
","So, before I talk about the episode, let me just say that after the first half of season three I had a hard time with this show. I already talked about that in my review for episode one. But it definitely improved a little with season four again. I hope they will find their way back to the season two glory. So, this episode opens up with a new character that was controlled by ALIE. I hope that we will see more of this character in the future and not just this episode because I think there could be a pretty interesting, yet kind of already seen before story line. But I could come to terms with it, when it's done well. Overall though I have to say that the beginning with this new character felt kind of cheesy.Also, something I thought for a long time now but never mentioned anywhere, is that the camera feels a little unprofessional to say it that way. I know that not many people care about this or that some people might disagree, but when the camera kind of zooms in on a characters face, but not really since the whole camera is moved, I am always reminded of Scary Movie. It just feels not as great as it could be. But that's probably just me. We got a callback to Clarkes Dad, which was very interesting. I hope this will lead us somewhere later in this season. Jasper is still annoying as hell, but he was ever since season two. So this is not a surprise. I hoped at the end of season three that it would get better, but it seems like it won't. Oh well. My favorite character of this episode is definitely Monty. I really enjoyed his decisions and I was genuinely moved by what he did. Raven seems to be very bitter about everything, she has a right to be, but it just seems like that there is no real development there. Some bad things always happen to her, she gets bitter, more bad things happen to her. The story line of Octavia being crazy bad-ass is continued, which I really enjoy. But I think they try a little too hard to make us feel weird about her. Overall, connected to Octavia, I really enjoyed the Polis story line. I am looking forward to what the future holds there. Overall, I am pretty pleased with this episode. Definitely looking forward to the next one and definitely hoping for a great season four."

","That was fast. Episode two of the season and the show already has poor Bellamy having to take life-and-death decisions. Poor Bellamy should just give up and become a monk but it does for another poignant and difficult moment for the character. And Bob Morley again does a great job in making the character multifaceted.Otherwise we have the continuation of the aftermath of the City of Light story-line, with some people not very happy with Roan's decisions and wanting to teach him a couple of things about leadership.The episode is a very solid one, with great rhythm, exceptional distribution of the screen time and really good atmosphere. The new story-lines are there and now we can center on the survival of the human race. And ""The 100"" again has lots of fun making its characters have to take impossible decisions. Gripping and interesting, it will keep the viewer's interest and leave them wanting for more."
173,47,9,1," Back to its old glory.
","I couldn't be happier. This episode finally went back to the glory that was The 100 season 2. Jaha maybe has an idea to rescue everyone instead of just 100. The flame was stolen from Rowan who orders Octavia to get it back. Luna is in need of medical treatment. This is by far the best episode of The 100 since season 2. I am so surprised that actually nothing bothered me about this episode. Probably because Jasper wasn't in it but overall as well. The acting was more than solid, everyone did a good job. The story is not really the most surprising one full of twists and turns, but it is definitely enjoyable. The characters acted logically. Everyone followed their own beliefs, stayed in character if you will, instead of making one dumb decision after another. (And they did not blame Clarke for everything, but that seems to come around in the next episode again according to the preview). Clarke and Bellamy shared an amazing scene together. It was pretty emotional and very well acted, which is why it really moved me. The only thing that kind of bothered me about this episode is that it still feels like this is not leading anywhere. I know, they'll probably find a way to save the majority of the people, but it also feels like this season (or at least the first half) tries to build tension and drama by letting the characters run in circles from one last (or lost) hope to another. Up until now it's alright because it's only the third episode of this season, but if it continues it's going to be a bit old. Anyways, I really enjoyed this episode and I hope they can keep it up like this for the rest of the season. And then there's the possibility that this show gets back to my Top 3 again."

","""The Four Horsemen"" is an entertaining episode, with lots of interesting situations, a little bit of plot development and great moments for some characters that, however, doesn't seem to know where it is going.Bellamy and Clarke team up with Jaha to search for salvation. Raven is losing her patience and in Arkadia things are getting worse and worse. Octavia tries to help the new king Roan. And the radiation may even be closer than expected.All story-lines of the episode are well developed and some moments are surprising because they take some unexpected turns. It is helped with good acting and great mood, with the characters having to take some difficult decisions. Unfortunately, all the good aspects that keep making ""The 100"" great apocalyptic sci-fi cannot overcome the feeling that this new threat (right now) is not very mysterious or clear, in part because the plot doesn't seem to really know where it is going (maybe the writers stretching a little bit the main story-line). Nevertheless, ""The 100"" keeps being thrilling."

","I had had the feeling that ""The 100"" had started this fourth season a little bit insecure of where it was planning to go, the feeling that the story was starting to be stretched thin. The third episode, fun but slow, seemed to confirm the situation. The focus wasn't there and it was running in circles.Well, here it comes the fourth episode. The pace is still a little bit shaky, and some of the dialogue could be improved. However, so many things happen that the viewer will not know with which twist the story will surprise them next. And all those developments help the story progress and focus.Marcus and Roan have some relationship issues. Octavia is angry (surprise). Bellamy has problems. Clarke has her own problems, with Jasper and Monty. And Raven, Murphy and others go on a quest to Becca's lab. So many things happen from that moment on that it will not be a surprise if you lose track of all of them.This episode shows the strengths ""The 100"" has. The dialogue is good (again, a couple of exchanges could have been improved), and it shows the ambivalence of the characters, the difficulty in taking decisions, the fear of violence and death. Decisions have consequences, but decisions also have reasons. Kane and Octavia's or Clarke and Jaha's scenes clearly show this strength. The atmosphere is great, and the feel of danger, threat, permeates every frame. It all hangs on the good shoulders of the actors, who again deliver and the direction that keeps all in place.And if that is not enough, the show reminds us that it is not scared to getting rid of characters."

","This is more like a 9.5 stars for me. It started out a bit sloppy, but it got better so fast and ended with a big bang. Abby, Raven and Jackson work on creating Night Blood. Octavia warns Arcadia about the Ice Nation. Clarke tries to negotiate. Honestly, I think this is one of my favorite episodes not just of this season, but of the show in general. I am very happy that the show finally seems to get it's feet back to the ground. If it continues to get better like this, or even just stays the same as it is now, season 4 could become my favorite season this far. I really enjoyed the acting in this one. There were of course some of the new casting that still try to find their ground, but everyone did a good job. Especially the main cast, even more especially Eliza Taylor as Clarke. I really enjoyed her subtlety in this episode. The story was really good in this one as well. Like I said, the beginning was not as great, a bit of sloppiness here and there, but it got so good. I really felt it this time, like a slow burn I felt the story to become more and more intense. I really appreciate that. A little thing still bothered me though. And that is that the relationship between Monty and Harper still makes me a bit uncomfortable. But that is entirely subjective. And, what a big surprise, the biggest issue I had with this show this season so far was the camera. But, it didn't bother me at all this episode. I even dare to go as far and say that it was actually pretty good. Yes, I am indeed surprised. Overall, one of the best episodes this far honestly. I hope they can stay on this level of quality and not go down again like they did last season. But I'm pretty hopeful and I'm really looking forward to see if they can top this episode in the finale."

And... will Octavia survive?The episode centers on the oncoming clash between Roan and his people and Arkadia's population and it delivers a gripping and full of strength episode, with a great pace, amazing atmosphere, good acting all around, and a couple of plot twists that will keep the viewers gripped to their seats, so worried will they be with what may or may not happen. The episode does a great job in explaining why it is better to collaborate than compete, but the difficulties behind people joining forces for a better outcome for everyone.""The Tinder Box"" is still, though, a little bit all over the place. ""The 100"" is starting to show signs of the need to create the path for a clear and satisfying ending. And Raven's story-line is a little bit silly (even if the plot more or less explains why and how happens what happens).However, these are minor problems. The best episode of the season."

Raven desperately tries to find a way to survive a trip into space.Unfortunately, this episode kind of starts doing what I hoped the season would not. Running in circles. Now it kind of seems like they're creating a new possible hope every episode just to take it away again in the end. And I am starting to not enjoy that. In Arcadia, however, we were presented with a pretty decent story line, and yet another throwback to Pike. It was interesting to see how quickly everyone would hit their breaking point resulting in being angry enough to do anything. Octavia's descent into madness was portrayed decently as well. I kind of have an inkling where this is going... But I could be surprised. Overall, Marie Avgeropoulos did a tremendous job this time. She acted her final scene in this episode very well. The acting was good overall as well. No really weak parts, pretty enjoyable performances. But... The dialogue... Oh my god. Honstly? This was kind of one of the worst dialogue in this show since the first few episodes. I did not enjoy it felt like cringing a lot. In the end, this episode was enjoyable. But definitely had it's flaws. Not the best, not the worst."

","""We Will Rise"" is a great episode that shows, again, the strengths of ""The 100"" and its position as a very smart (even if sometimes conventional) show. And it does in a way that overcomes the lack of focus that it is having this season.Clarke, Bellamy and Roan have to deliver fuel to Raven for her trip. Raven, which is getting crazy at the impossibility of doing the mission with the little fuel they have left ('poor' Murphy paying for her frustration). And at what is left from Arkadia people are asking for revenge, blood and a sacrifice.The show intertwines the three story-lines of the episode flawlessly, with great pace, amazing scenes, and great direction. It doesn't give a moment of respite, and, in the few moments where the action slows down, it gives us plot development and character study, developing the characters we have got to care for. And if that was not enough it also keeps touching on aspects about power, class, humanity and what is behind our decisions, humanizing all the characters along the way. The reasons behind the character's decisions make sense, even if you may not agree with them. That the show won't let go of these classical but always relevant questions is a plus.""The 100"" still has a lot to offer."

The dialogue is completely off and feels fake. A constant flow of random elements and clich√© moments were thrown in my face, leaving me shivering in agony. I just begged for this episode to stop, and finally, after 41 minutes and 42 seconds of suffering and crying, it let me go.Please don't force me through an episode like this ever again, or I will definitely stop watching the 100 for good."

","The black rain arrived. Bellamy tries to save a father and his son. Clarke considers a controversial way to save humanity. Octavia is trying to distract herself from her demons. This episode was way too predictable for me unfortunately. I didn't enjoy Octavias story line that much, since I knew what was coming since the previous episode. Bellamys story line was just filler. We were supposed to feel something, but because the emotional factor of the episode was relying on characters we never saw, it kind of fell flat for me. The savior of this episode was actually Clarke and Abby contemplating on a way to save humanity even if it involves possibly killing someone else. That was very interesting. Especially the final scene was pretty powerful. In the end, 7 stars thanks to Clarke, Abby and Emori. Other than that, it was a little disappointing."

","and nonetheless, an engrossing one.Clarke and her mother have to take some difficult decisions. Bellamy is carrying a burden that no one asked him to. And Octavia has a human 'burden' of her own.And the black rain is coming...The episode is a very slow one, moody, with a very good atmosphere, that centers on the development of the characters and in giving them (and us) time to breathe and reflect on what has been going on till now. As Bellamy, Bob Morley again shines, but it is becoming a little bit repetitive having him all the time struggling with decisions of life and death. Emori also has her own moment, and her relationship with Murphy keeps developing in very interesting ways. Less fulfilling is Octavia's side quest to find herself, but the episode never gets boring. With characters as interesting as ""The 100"" has to offer, it is difficult to fail. ""Gimme Shelter"" delivers."

All the while, Jaha thinks he has the answer (keeping his own god complex) and takes Kane and Monty on a trip.The episode does a great job in keeping both story-lines gripping and with lots of twists and surprises. Clarke's group has to take very difficult decisions, and even if it comes close to being a little bit cheesy in some plot turns, it overcome this to deliver a gripping story-line.

Its natural or a contrived and stretched one we still don't know.Jasper and some are giving up, not wanting to keep living in a hole. Clarke and Roan have some decisions to take. Many other characters have decisions to take.The episode gives us the chance to share some time with almost all of its characters. It is curious that it has left Bellamy on the sidelines for the last couple of episodes, as well as Octavia, even if we get to be with both of them. It is all the rest that we get the chance to see how they face their options: dying or surviving. Many seem to decide that surviving is not enough. If that is not enough for the viewer, we also get some of those petty human fights, about selfishness, pride and hate, that the show is so good at. The plot and the character development are strong, and the acting delivers. The atmosphere is one of dread and hopelessness and death seems to be waiting for all of them.

Well, it does a great job. It has nice action set pieces, a couple of nice twists (and a great one) within the set up, and lots of bloody moments.

Bellamy, who had been on the sidelines on many of the episodes this season, takes center stage and Bob Morley, as always, delivers. His Bellamy is full of layers and subtlety, even if in this case, his path is chosen for him and quite straightforward. Even with these downsides, the plot is thrilling, twisting and engaging, and it delivers without forgetting about giving depth to the story.The rest of the story-lines are also interesting (Raven's is probably the weakest) and help in showing us how many options and decisions we are allowed to take on an extreme situation, and how freedom is not as free as we may believe.

Or will they have?What could have been an uneven episode, as the plot is again about choosing 100 survivors, is turned upside down by clever plot twists and great use of the characters. Kane or Jaha have their time to shine and we get to enjoy their character's development and understand the decisions they take. The episode does a great use of the set up and raises the tension slowly to a surprising ending. Sometimes it is all a little bit in-your-face, subtlety be damned, but in general, the dealing of the moral dilemmas and subjects of ""The 100"" is done in a great manner.

","Clarke tries to survive on her own. The group on the ark discovers another spaceship. Prisoners arrive on earth. I am very happy that this season stars out as strong as it did. Especially with the premieres of seasons 3 and 4, I had been a bit disappointed, but this one hit the mark. 
At first I had been pretty cautious. I did not know what to expect of this episode since I only liked the first six episodes of season 3 and was absolutely caught by surprise by the strong and captivating last four episodes of season 4. So I had no idea if I were able to like this one. If it continued being as strong of an episode like the last episodes had been. And I can say, yes. The 100 keeps its strongest suit, which are the characters. 
We get a lot of Clarke in this episode. And that was a great choice. Seeing her trying to survive was equally exciting and heartbreaking. You really see how strong she is yet again, but you can also see that she is slowly losing it. I liked to see that contrast between strength and vulnerability, and I hope we will see a lot more of it. Eliza Taylor really is a talented actress. She nailed every single one of her lines. 
We see a bit of the people on the Ark as well, experiencing some new dynamics between characters me might did not expect. I can't see that I like every one of these dynamics, since one of them reminded me a lot of the premiere in season 3. But I am interested to see where they will go with it. 
The new addition to the cast, Lola Flanery as Madi, did a decent job as well, in those scenes we actually did see her and not a younger version. Though Lina Renna, the actress of young Madi, did a good job too. Overall, there were no really weak links in the cast, just like I expected. There were a few illogical scenes here and there which I do not want to spoil, but they did not bother too much. I liked this episode and I am looking forward to more of it."

We find a desperate and hopeless Clarke, alone, without friends or purpose, and with no idea on how she will survive till her friends come back. She tries to find a way to open the entrance and join the survivors at Second Dawn, but she soon has to give up and try to survive by herself. Pretty soon she finds a companion and we get to the moment in which season four ended, with the prisoner space ship landing on her valley. Also we get some snippets on the life Bellamy and the others are leading on their little and broken spaceship.The plot is simple but is delivered in a great way, with good direction and solidly anchored by Eliza Taylor's performance, which is a great one, her acting keeping the viewer with their eyes on the screen. She does a great job in bringing the world and her character to life while we stay with her, and with her we get introduced to this new and desolate world, even worse that the one they were on before. It also helps that the episode gives us time to feel and understand this new world we are in, and the little breaks from it to go to the spaceship on which Bellamy and the others are feels like a perfect counterpoint to what is happening on Earth.""Eden"" does a great job of picking things up after the ending of season four while delivering, probably, the best first episode of any of the five seasons of the show. Amazing."

","Great first episode, it's going to be tough waiting week to week for a new episode. Ugh"
219,58,9,1," Interesting start.
","We get to see how everyone's going past 6 years. The episode is not boring, it is enjoyable. For me this is good enough for the first episode."
220,58,4,0," Defying logic
","Once you understand the unique physics of the show, the special relationship between time and space... and you think you got it. Everything changes, why not. 
After 20 years in a radioactive world with magic food and water and with nobody aging like normal human beings, the show feels like a hot rock thrown between uncompetitive scriptwriters trying to avoid the inevitable crash of the plot, that normally happens every 15min, in every episode since season 2.
This opening would feel like 3 or 4 shortfilms smashed together trying to make sense between each other. 
I do NOT understand the ultra hyped reciews of fanatic 100's"
221,58,6,0," What is this?
","Dead bodies that are moving, bad script writing and some awful acting. This is not the 100 as i remembered it. I'm pretty shocked of the good reviews al with high ratings considered this is in my opinion one of the worst the 100 episodes ever. The last season was still pretty cool although it didn't had the flow of the first en second season but that's understandable. After making a couple of good seasons it's hard to come up with new creative ideas and until now the failed on that point with season 5. There is no logic in the actions that the characters make especially Clarke (Eliza Taylor). Already at a couple of minutes in the episode i was kinda bored because of that and the lazy script writing. When i saw an extra getting quickly in his dead body position at 18:57 i was completely done. Then throw in some acting from Lola Flanery and voil√† you got yourself a bad episode. Now i know that the cast and crew is putting some crazy effort in this tv show so that's why i give it a six."

231,59,10,1," Damn.
","Octavia has to take a stand to save the bunker from starvation. So... I am really lost for words with this episode. This was absolutely amazing. I did not expect The 100 to shock me again after the season 4 finale. But it did. And I loved every second of it. The acting was top notch, except for one of the new characters. There was this one scene that stood out as not as good, but overall it was believable. So I have not much to complain about in this department. I love the dark route this story takes. But be prepared. It really is a dark route. Octavia stood her ground in this episode, which I loved. She used to be a bit annoying to me if I am honest, but with this episode I am definitely a fan of hers. 
Indra and Gaia have an interesting relationship together, but it is also pretty distant. I am interested to see if we see any development there. 
I am very happy that Eric Jackson and Nathan Miller get more screentime. I really hope they get their own arcs as well. They were actually the light in all this darkness this episode for me.And the ending left me absolutely speechless. So yes. The 100 is back. It is so freaking back. 
I can't wait for the next episode."

Yeh there was some lazy writing the whole let's put a strong emotional connection between two characters so when they die you feel bad! Aside from that Octavia totally made up for that and the first episode which was pretty poor! Octavia has pretty much always been my favourite character but this episode she totally exceeded my expectations what an amazing bad ass!!!!!!!!
234,59,10,1," One Word.... AMAZING

I definitely hope this will continue. I loved the character dynamics, though I am a bit confused and annoyed with what happened to Murphy and Emori.
The action was superb, the choreography was spot on, the acting was great... And the ending was freaking amazing. 
Why isn't it a 10/10 then? 
I honestly don't know. But it somehow did not capture me as much as ""Red Queen"" did, so I had to express that somehow. 
But other than that, it is an amazing episode and I can't wait for the next one."

","Bellamy tries to make a deal with the prioners. Raven and Murphy are waiting for orders. Octavia lets Marcus fight for his freedom. This was an intense episode. It was suspenseful all throughout and I loved all the character moments we got, while at the same time I was a bit frustrated with some of them. 
It seems like this is going to be an action-packed season. I definitely like that, but I hope we will also get a few new and interesting interactions as well, and that people like Jackson, Miller, Harper, Emori and Echo get their own story lines. They, at this point, are very underdeveloped. The biggest critique I have though is that at this point, except Shaw, all the villains are exactly that. Villains. And I think it would be much more interesting if we saw a bit more of their human side.Other than that, I really enjoyed this episode. And I am definitely looking forward to the next one."

It is right on par with (and possibly even better than) last week's ""Sleeping Giants,"" which I personally consider to be the best episode of The 100 so far. With many emotional reunions & crazy moments, this episode did not disappoint in the slightest. The plot has been set for the rest of Season 5 and with war is on the horizon, we're bound to be in for an insane ride! 10/10 episode!!!"

All the characters keep being interesting, with the exception of McCreary, who continues to be kind of your stereotypical bad guy. 
Some characters I liked before I start to dislike and vice versa. This is not necessarily critique, since it is probably wanted that way, so I am just interested where those individual story lines are going to go.However, I really did like the ending. It really makes me look forward to what is going to come next.

I really enjoyed all the plotting and intrigue going on here, especially when it came to showing where each others allegiances lie. It was a very suspenseful episode that had me at the edge of my seat several times. I do not know how to pick one certain favorite character anymore, let alone two or three. This season is definitely starting to prove itself to be the best we have seen yet of The 100. I do have one complain though. McCreary is still way too bland in my opinion to be particularly interesting. Still just the cut-out bad guy, no real depth to his character... I am really hoping they will go a deeper route with him after this episode. Let's see where this goes."

","Echo tries to follow through with her plan. Clarke and Monty make a terrifying discovery. Octavia schemes against Shadow Valley.This was yet again a very good episode, showing even more character development than before. I really like all the new character interactions.
But I am very conflicted about who I want to root for. Every single person has a valid point in this war. No one is entirely good or bad. (Except McCreary, but, you know, still hope for character development...) And that is exactly why I love this season so much. Every loss would hurt. Every victory would be bittersweet. I can not wait how this continues. 
And thank GOODNESS that we finally get another episode next week, not two weeks later."

","Another great episode for season 5. To be honest, I really didn't get into season 4 and wasn't expecting much out of season 5. Happy to say, I was completely wrong.In 'How We Get To Peace' we have more of the tense moments between all the main character conflicts and some unexpected twists in a couple of them. The scenes between Bellamy and Octavia were great (even with her sudden voice change) and felt like they had weight to them, but I really like Raven in this episode. Lindsey Morgan's performances keep getting better every season and her skills are shown off again in this episode.My only complaint about this season is they keep having two week breaks after showing only two episodes."
263,65,10,1," The Things We Do For Peace.
","This episode was amazing. It once again proved that nobody is entirely good or evil. 
The many character moments we had in this episode were great, and I am definitely surprised of the turns some of them made. Even though it seems to be unavoidable to realize that some characters are not going to survive this season. 
And one character seems to be the most likely candidate for that, but I am not going to spoil it. 
I even love Dioza, even though I was convinced in season 3 and parts of season 4, that every season will be one big bad that will be put down by the end of the season, I really hope Dioza stays. Since she is not entirely bad, but also because she has a very interesting story I want to see a lot more of. The only thing I have to complain about is that we have to wait two weeks again for the next episode. This is really starting to go on my nerves."

","First thing first, I began tired of good guys trying to avoid war. Maybe the 100 could do something new, entirely. This loop is recycling over and over. People want war and good guys try to find a way to stop it. Anyway the episode is great. Intense and tough."
266,65,10,1," This is how you write a diverse show.
","Oh my god, I'm in love with this show. In a world of rampant check-crossing and politically-correct but ultimately-empty soundbites, this show continues to shine the beacon of hope for all.Strong, leading roles of either sex, difficult moral decisions abound.Rather than the standard Women Smart: Men Stupid trope of pretty much every ""action sci fi"" genre show that cynically replaces a male with a female, written as a male, this show portrays powerful women who are still able to look up to both men and women equally.Moreover, in this show, deeply, meaningfully written, multidimensional male characters are shown to full effect. They are shown to respect and love their women and look as much towards peace as they do conflict, rather than simply being the shallowly written, testosterone^drenched muscular leads that abound.In this show there are also depictions of bloodthirsty, desperate women who pine for blood and death and men bereft of love once more finding power and rediscovering themselves...This show really is a textbook display on how a modern drama should be done...I adore that this show lays out the pain of utter defeat as much as it does the blissful transcendence of success. It shows the darkness within us just as it does the benevolence of man and it plays upon despair as much as it does hope. Yet amazingly, it only rarely gets cloyingly preachy: A problem other shows often fail to avoid.All in all a fantastic, well written show with captivating character and mythos."
267,66,10,1," That last scene tho

With The 100, you don't get an easy way out. Everything is complicated. And that's what makes it so damn exciting. I am so looking forward to the next episode. And I am very positive that this season will do nothing but continue to blow me away."

","Abby is in withdrawal. Clarke continues to try and keep Madi safe. Octavia faces impossible choices.It was really interesting to see how Octavia deals with the traitors, though I kind of saw it coming. Marie Avgeropolous continues to impress me with her acting. This season, she really blows me away every time she is on screen. I'd love to see more of that. 
The outcome of that situation was rather obvious too though, unfortunately. I had hoped for something more gut-wrenching. 
While I am mostly on Clarkes side in this situation, she did something in the beginning of the episode that felt out of character, rather reckless and dare I say stupid. The actress of Madi also does a solid job, and her story just gets more and more interesting as well. 
And I also do really admire Indra for her loyalty. And her courage. Her scenes were pretty good. Overall, this was a good episode, but unfortunately not the best one yet. I am definitely looking forward to the last three episodes of this season, since the showrunner Jason Rothenberg said himself, episodes 11, 12 and 13 were his Top 3 favorite of this season. So I am expecting great things. 
After this season overall, I am positive the finaly will be amazing as well."
278,67,10,1," Insanely Intense
","Man. I just can't remember a TV Series being this intense. This episode is good, really good. The reviewer saying Abby and Octavia are dragging the entire show down must be watching a different program, living in an alternate universe, on some potent substance, or being emotionally distorted by the heavy content conveyed by those actors. As someone who has physically experienced opiate WD's, Abby's depiction was actually TOO realistic and riveting for me.I just grow so weary of the ""the storylines COULD have been so good"" or ""it had SO much potential"" criticisms. I get it if you just don't like something or it's not your cup of tea, but if 90% of viewership is not ready to ""clean house"", how pretentious is it to think your conclusions are sufficient enough to make major production staff changes ? I propose that maybe YOUR house be cleaned and examine what internal issues are causing your negative viewpoints, while we stick with the satisfied 90%.If all these arm-chair screen writing experts could show me their portfolios so I can see what a REAL masterpiece looks like, I would greatly appreciate it. It's important to distinguish the difference between ""bad, sloppy writing"" and just a storyline or character arc that doesn't happen to be YOUR personal preferred direction or choice.
""Time to clean house"".... Yeah I'm sure the producers will get right on that for ya. Peace."

","So, this review is going to consist of two parts. First, my non-spoilery review, and after that, a spoiler discussion/reaction about the episode. This was an intense and disturbing episode. The more that was revealed about the Dark Year, the more shocked I was. The plots tied in perfectly with each other, and the episode ended at a really intense situation, that has me scared for the next two episodes. 
As of right now, this is probably my favorite season of the whole show. Who knew that a show, whichs 3rd season I hated, could catch itself in such an amazing manner and have me at the edge of my seat the whole time? I am most certainly impressed. The acting of everyone was top notch. There is not much more I can say to this, without going into spoiler territory. But I definitely recommend watching this episode. This season in general. It is just an amazing journey. (SPOILER FROM THIS POINT FORWARD!)
As soon as the ""previously on The 100"" started playing, I had to pause to get some food. Because I don't think I would have survived it otherwise. Even then, I wasn't ready to start the episode.
But once I started, I immediately regretted the food part, due to Abbie vomiting. Which was delightful. 
As soon as McCreary walked in to the room where Clarke and Madi just tried to save Abbie, I thought now it would escalate. But it didn't. They somehow had a casual conversation in the next scene and I was just like ""???"". So yeah. I mean, of course, he spilled some threats and everything. But I would have expected him to immediately get rid of the two.The Murphy - Raven - Shaw dynamic is amazing and I want a million more scenes of that please.One thing that starts to bother me is Clarke kind of not giving a damn about anyone else... I mean, I do understand her motivations, but I would have liked to at least see more remorse or inner conflict from her.It was obvious that they resorted to cannibalism in the dark year, but I was surprised to see it reavealed that early on. It definitely made me wonder what else was in store for us this episode.Oh, and I also want more of this Murphy, Raven, Echo and Emori dynamic. Because yes. 
HOWEVER 
How freaking stupid was that plan? AND WHY, SHAW? WHY? <-- Back when I thought they'll be captured. 
Then I was like: YASSSS show me them badass fighting skills!The dinner scene was really hard to watch. I was definitely not prepared for this. I want to use this platform to express my deepest respect and love for the character Diyoza. At first I disliked her, now she is one of my favorite characters. I really hope she survives this season.The Bellarke family really has a rough spot this episode. I still feel bad for Octavia, even though she did a lot of stupid and gruesome things in the past few episodes. But I really held out hope for something in the Dark Year to be responsible for her actions.I had this theory early on, which I already commented on the YouTube-Video of the promo of this episode, that I think someone was pregnant (Abby) and Octavia had to shoot the baby. At least that's what it sounded like to me. 
But Abby suggesting that Octavia makes it a crime not to be a cannibal was extremely rough and disturbing. And Octavia acting on it and killing those who refused was even more screwed up. 
I do understand the mindset, though. She wants them to survive. Without food they die. When they are starved, they are not useful anymore when they're dead, so killing them now before its too late is sort of logical. Screwed up, but logical. But it was still extremely hard to watch.SHAW AND RAVEN KISS WAS EVERYTHINGBut Kane's decision to turn against Wonkru was shocking, to be honest. It made sense. But still. I was not prepared for this. And I am not prepared for the losses we are probably going to suffer.

So once again, all I can say is that this is my favorite season of this show, even beating season 2 and season 4, and I cannot wait for the two part finale."
284,68,9,1," The Hundred
","This season went on a completely different path than from the trailer I saw. It isn't the worst season of this shows history, however it isn't the best either. I hope this season can make up for it, with the last two episodes. 
 On a side note- where is the child that Jaha told Octavia to keep watch over? Why does this show just cut people from this series?"
285,68,10,1," Intense
",This is a very intense episode of a great series. Just a great show.
286,68,10,1," Holy cow!
","Octavia was the key to the dark year, for entirely different reasons than what I thought. What a reveal! This had one of the most intense scenes I've ever seen. Octavia got to show some acting range at last and she was great!"
287,68,10,1," Octavia Rising
","I just can't shake how much I love her character and it has to do with the actress , she is exceptional . This , I have garnered over a long standing relationship with this show . When I couldn't see it I would listen to it like a radio show ( sure I wished I could watch ) but even as an audio I fell into it something fierce , she is perfect in this role and I really can't wait to see more ... and sound quality of her voice !
Anyway story arch ! She is has come the furthest of an character she stays true to herself and she makes hard choices . I found myself trying to explain what I was into about this show and basically the story line that is jam- packed and rich with with twists and reveals. Then I launched into Octavia and .... well , I realized just how much her story has inspired me over the years . There is little doubt that had her role been played by a different actress I may not have the same allegiance.
I am defiantly Wonkru., that is FOR Wonkru lol. Everyone else flip flops, of course its the writing but how could anyone not admire Octavia at this point ? Throughout the revolving storylines she remains linear always moving forward and through.
Anyway, it's been a trip and I will miss this but I believe there are 2 more seasons .... yet this season seems to be leading up to a certain level of closure and while I am saddened, I am here for it ."
288,68,9,1," So much pros and cons.
","Pros here is
The story is surprisingly good and make sense.Characters development is insane. The 100 split up and walk their own path, it's kinda cool thinking about that.cons:
Too many betrayals and defectors in each episode. I mean, people switching sides too much that it confused me. It makes the story unreliable. Childish maybe. But that's it.The episode is good, intense and as always, enjoyable."
289,69,9,1," AAAARRRRGGHHHH
","It took me a long time to come to this point, but Clarke officially annoys the living daylights out of me. Enough is enough. I get why she is protective, but there is a line. And she crossed it tenfold.The war itself is pretty intense. It is hard to see people fighting each other when you don't 100% know who to root for, though compared to the rest of the season, choosing sides on this one is a bit easier.However, there were a lot of shocking but also emotional moments, that make this episode more than worth watching, proving once more that season 5 might just deserve to be considered the best season of The 100 yet."
290,69,5,0," Getting too muddy
","It's getting annoying, how many times will the characters switch sides not to talk it always happens in a matter of seconds. Kane is this, Diyoza is that, Abby is this etc it's just getting too confusing.Stop teasing us about some of the characters coming to their end;Abby almost died but she miraculously popped up - I don't care if she dies really!Kane was attacked and unconscious - i could care less if he dies tooWhat? They're telling the McCreary guys couldn't shot Octavia who was in an open field but they shot down those other soldiers who just moved an inch?And Indra must be the most luckiest character in the entire show, she miraculously survived every attack or massacre e.g she was the last survivor when Bellamy and pike killed off all her troops, she survived another massacre when the azgeda soldiers attacked them protecting the temple and now she survived an ambush by McCreary's guys, and what's even funny is that they were at the Frontline if anyone should die, it should be her and the others at the front.
Gaia's death was teased too but nothing happened - I could care less if she dies either.
Now I might be in the minority here but I actually like Clarke being overprotected, no think about it, they've through hell and back together in those 6 years. She's like a mother figure to Madi so it make sense the way she behaved.The main characters are totally lacking direction and are getting annoying, I don't know why this episode got lots of stars."
291,69,7,0," I HATE CLARKE
",She has been the most hated character i have seen on this show and its sick
292,69,6,0," End of the line
","OK, maybe I'm not the smartest guy around but the plot is getting too convoluted for my taste. Can't really say who belongs to which faction or why they switch sides in seconds. Understand the underlying idea of them all trying to get possesion of the ""garden of Eden""without destryoing it (too much). But come on guys! This show started as a pretty girl / guy show with a thought of a story, then it got really good and now it's back to watching pretty girls / guys doing some shooting and what not. This show had it's day clearly, round it up now please."
293,69,8,1," Helicopter Mother
",Mentally ill helicopter mother strikes back. Got a cognitive dissonance after this. Everything else was good though.
294,69,9,1," Kind of annoying, not perfect, but great.
",Ignoring Clarke's nonsense. Everything's fine. Here comes the conclusion of the story. Next episode they gonna unleases everything and that's gonna be fun.
295,70,10,1," May we meet again
","Best last 10 minutes of any episode and best season finale I've seen so far on TV, can't wait till the next season."
296,70,10,1," OMG
",Doesn't get any better than this. This show just keeps getting better and better.
297,70,10,1," I was blown away
",All sci-fi fans should watch the 100 just to see this episode.
298,70,10,1," IT WAS
",OUT OF THIS WORLD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
299,70,10,1," JAW-DROPPING
","This episode is the best finale I have watched for any show, ever. In 40 minutes, the writers were able to infuse all the elements of an epic storyline. I cried, then smiled, felt an adrenaline rush as time was running out, and it finally concluded with a jaw-dropping wrap up. I would have never guessed or imagined an ending like this. This was more than just unpredictability, it was innovation. I loved every second of it. I wish I can also go to ""bed"" til the next season airs."
300,70,10,1," GREAT!
","Great episode! Madi was incredible, happy to see a lot of my favorites survived, and excited for season 6!"
301,70,10,1," You just can't rate it lower
","For years, i was watching this TV Show. In the season 1, i saw potential. Season 2 dissapointed me a little, but it was good after all. Season 3 was good.But the show changed. Season 4 and Season 5 can be easily compared to what game of thrones or breaking bad are / were showing us. The TV Show grew so much that it can be called a masterpiece. It deserves that. There is no weak point in season 4 and 5.Now, talking about the episode i'm writing this review about, it was what television has to show its viewers. There is no SF movie or SF Tv Show who did it better than the 100 with this episode. For me, a huge fan of Game of Thrones, it's the best TV Episode i've ever seen. Also, a huge fan of Star Wars, LOTR, and others, i can say, in my opinion, it has the impact of a good-made movie like those i called earlier.Once again, no weak point! It's unbelievable how good it could be! Look at the new recurring character, Madi. Her character development was awesome, ending with the Damocles: Part 2, where she was a true character, where she became a true leader, and, for us, a main character we'll love to see in the next seasons.I think the next season will be awesome. They made this too: they settled a new story they can bring to us, one with a lot of potential. I hope it will not be repetitive (we won't see the same conflict from Seasons 1 and 2, or even 3). It has to be something new. It has to be something that will make us say: ""HOW?"".In conclusion, for those who didn't watch this episode yet, do it. For those who didn't watch this TV Show yet (if there still are people who didn't), watch it! I can assure you won't regret it. Of course, it has some issues to, but, trust me, there are so few that you won't even notice them."
302,70,10,1," What the hell!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
","Just finished watching 5 season after just 6 days (I know you probably do the same thing after the first episode). I just don't know how I ignored this amazing show.
season 3 was a little bit weak. but again after that it's getting better and better till the season 5 finale. As a person who see a lot of movies and series, It had everything. season 5 finale was beyond the great. I'm sure you won't be able to even blink in this episode, Specially in the last 8 minutes.
Why are you still reading this?!
Go watch it dude..."
303,70,10,1," Best Ep[isode Yet
","I have always found The 100 to be way above my initial expectations, but this final episode of Season 5 takes it to a whole new level. The final 5-6 minutes was science fiction at its absolute finest, up there with the best of Star Trek or even 2001: A Space Odyssey. And because I try not to supply spoilers, you will have to watch it to see for yourself.This episode starts with the classic war for survival on planet Earth, and some of it became a bit too glorified war epic for my taste. There are some tender moments that involve Clarke and Madi and Bellamy and Octavia, and there is a ridiculous down to the wire moment that I could have done without. That ending though, quiet, thoughtful, compassionate, spiritual, moving, and so well done. It was simply some of the best television I have seen."
304,70,10,1," Tears!
","I have never ever cried because of a movie or a tv show, but today, I cried like a baby! Such a rollercoster of emotion. Can't wait for next season."
305,70,10,1," I don't even know how to word it.
",Wow. Just wow. That's my review. Go watch for yourself and enjoy.
306,70,10,1," First time I ever written a review
","Like the title says, it's the absolute first time that I write a review, neve really felt compelled to write about the (thousands) of films and TV Series I watch, mainly because everybody already said everything about them.With this episode, that changed. I've watch this series since the first episode, and even though sometimes along the seasons it bored me a bit, I've never gave up on it, specially because in the middle of the never ending loop of chaos and rebirth, there was something new and interesting happening. And in this 13rd episode right in the middle of that chaotic spiral that characterises The 100 season endings, they've managed to surprise me in a way I've never expected. Now I just look forward to next season, knowing I won't be disappointed."
307,70,10,1," Amazing
","Ep 12 and 13 broke some of the momentum of what I thought a was a great season. Maybe that was just me. But as 13 went on it was really great. I started liking the twist at the end, and then BOOM an even bigger twist. It was so sad really, I was shocked and then I cried as I saw what happened. Wow, it's gonna be amazing next season. Cannot wait!"
308,70,10,1," Very different season compared to the rest of the show.
","Yet as brilliant as the season 2 finale, as brutal as the season 3 finale and as emotional as the season 4 finale.I'm a little sceptical regarding what they could do with season 6, but I thought the exact same thing a year ago about season 5."
309,70,10,1," The Best
","That is probably the best end to a season ive ever seen from a series, so much so i had to watch it again. So much Promise for season six, looking forward to it."
310,70,10,1," Mindblowing
","Wow.. I am floored by how the 100 never fails to exceed my expectations. The last 5 minutes were an absolute masterpiece in terms of acting, soundtrack, visuals, and laying down the foundation for the next season in a satisfying way that still leaves you wanting more. I was a little concerned it was going to stay within the storylines that were already explored in the past seasons, but this is a completely new directions with so many possibilities. It doesn't feel forced or out of the blue; it's very organic although I never would have expected it. I love how the 100 can be so many shows at once without making it a weird patchwork of wannabe genres. I absolutely can't wait for season 6 (and I never want this show to end if you ask me)."
311,70,10,1," Beyond Epic, this is Emmy Worthy performance .
","What a tremendous show with a terrific cast , certainly one of the best TV series on television without a doubt and i can put it to the test.The 100 is more than a Gem . As a Fan of the show from season 1 to season 5 ,i can say that the team on this set has done themselves proud , wow what an episode season 5 episode 13 came to be ,emotions all over. Waiting patiently for season 6."
312,70,10,1," Best finale yet
","Just wow... words can't describe the feels from this episode. The 100 just never disappoints, even when it has to end some of your favourite characters. Loved it since S1, can't wait for S6!!"
313,70,10,1," OMG
",OMG. Can you start the next season already!!. It just get better and better every season. Kudos to u guys
314,70,10,1," I have no words!
","It was amazing to see how this serie has evolved! We started with a great season, then by the time season 2 arrived I had my doubts. Season 3 was good. But when season 4 arrived I fell in love for this series one more time! At the beginning of season 5 I wasn't that happy with the plot the had gave us but throughout the season I was thrilled! And with this finally I can express my happiness and how much I wait for season 6 to come!"
315,71,9,1," A Whole New World!
","Just when you think The 100 have found peace, it hits you again that they're in danger! This episode was perfectly paced, and had great relationships continuity from previous seasons. It puts our heroes in high stakes, and was really enjoyable to watch. I saw it twice now and I'm up to watch it even more! Great writing as usual! üëèüèªüëèüèª"
316,71,9,1," Good start with a lot of mystery...
","After the last season final episode I felt I couldn't be more shocked with this series so I wonder what will happen in this season. Well... after I heard they renewed the show for the seventh season I became a little bit more hopeful because somehow it means they're sure about this season success.
For now I give the premiere 9 stars."
317,71,10,1," A Breathtaking Beginning
","What can I say, this premiere had everything I could ask for and then some. The cinematography, colors and visuals were breathtakingly beautiful. There were some powerful character interactions, most of which built upon what we saw happen in Season 5. Several callbacks to the pilot episode, both subtle and obvious, were so awesome to see. The world-building was great too and will only continue to get better as the season progresses. Murphy provided some great comedic relief throughout also. And of course with The 100, there will always be crazy, shocking twists and this premiere featured a couple major ones!This episode was so great in so many ways and I think it might be the best The 100 premiere so far!! Season 6 has an incredible amount of potential and I cannot wait to see how it all pans out!"
318,71,10,1," Wonderful Start
","A great start that gets the plots of season 6 going straight away but also spending time to deal with the events of the previous seasons, something that season 5 needed a bit more of. Looks promising for the rest of the season!"
319,71,10,1," Stunning!
","Absolutely stunning! Great premiere, fantastic pacing and great acting. It's everything you would want to see in a premiere."
320,71,10,1," Good episode
",I think the events on this episode and the end it's more exciting and reasonable than got s8 ep3
321,71,10,1," Good but could be better
","It could be better but I get it, it's the first episode and I don't have a clue where this is going."
322,71,9,1," what an opening!
","Behind the blaring Got8 euphoria, The100 still a mainstay series with an opening episode that always makes my lips bitten."
323,71,10,1," Thank you for this
","I was so sad,angry,lost form GOT. But this is my salvation. It is simply a diamond. Thank you writers and actors for such an amazing premiere and show. This is perfect!"
324,71,10,1," Best Show!
","Every episode of this show has me on the edge of my seat from start to finish. I have a rollercoaster of emotions Anxiety is probably the one that hits me most I almost need to take anxiety breaks lol. Then tears of sadness and joy. I'm a mess!This episode is no different. Love the recap from Monty's POV, love the time jump and love the whole new direction. I'm trying to write this without giving anything away and its tricky.If you haven't watched this Series I suggest binge watching it on Netflix but take some breaks to catch your breath lol"
325,71,8,1," Awesome beginning.
","Episode 6.01 (4 out of 5 stars).After the survivors in space come across a new foreign planet which they may have found a new home. Bellamy, Clarke, Murphy and others search the strange planet. Which there is a mysterious secret about the unknown planet than meets their eye.A perfect start for the season. The characters are hoping to be a better person and have a fresh start. Some characters are stuck with their conflict from the last season like Raven is mad at Abigail for her addiction. And does not trust her. Octavia is conflicted about their actions. I am excited to see where this season goes next."
326,71,10,1," Best show on tv
","THIS IS THE BEST SHOW EVER! It was had everything drama, romance and action. The actors do such an amazing job!"
327,71,7,0," So new so original
","Run or hide when the two suns eclipsed just like when the black rain comes. So original, I haven't seen that before. Beautiful scenery tho."
328,71,9,1," A new beginning.
",A new beginning for all of them. New chance. We got some aftermath discussions. A new planet to discover. The 100 is doing better than ever. Character's conflict is getting more intense.This episode is great. fun to watch.
329,71,8,1," They're back
","Crew is growing older, but Raven is unrecognisable, I had to double check actresses name.Can't wait for more episodes."
330,72,9,1," Face Your Demons Already
","So... That tagline of this season was introduced pretty quickly.Intruders threaten the safety of the spaceship. Clarke and Bellamy try to deal with the consequences of the eclipse. Octavia lashes out again.This episode was extremely intense. There were so many great moments that I can't even list them and I am very excited to see where this is going.That being said, the Clarke hate continues and so does my annoyance. Hence I keep this short so that I won't repeat myself."
331,72,10,1," Good episode
",Great episode. This season could be the best season if they keep this up
332,72,10,1," Really good episode
",Pretty good episode and I have no clue where this going. This season is looking bright 10/10
333,72,8,1," Good second.
","Episode 6.02 (4 out of 5 stars).Another exciting episode that has Clarke, Bellamy, and Murphy trying to survive on the planet after they find out a mysterious secret about the planet. Which they have to battle their own demons to survive. While the people on the ship have to face against unexpected visitors which they are trying to handle each other. Exciting, fun, and action packed. It delivers the thrills while revealing some new story."
334,72,9,1," Getting better every season
",Very promosing secong episode of the 100s fresh start. the story is slowly building up and the mystery vibe of the first and second season returned.
335,72,9,1," Intense episode.
","Diyoza is such a badass. I love her. The story is intense, there are lots of really good moment. And the secret of the new planet is uncovering. Great episode."
336,72,9,1," humans go cray cray
","Man this episode was nuts. Humans land on a moon, coincidentally during an eclipse where u become a homicidal maniac."
337,73,10,1," I love this show
",Nothing makes me happier than a show that can continue to progress its story and its characters like the 100 has been. Amazing episode.
338,73,10,1," EXCELLENT!!!
","Excellent writing, excellent production ...and not disappointing like Game of Thrones..."
339,73,10,1," Great begginings
","This show deserves at least half the popularity of GoT. The writing here only gets better, unlike the latter."
340,73,10,1," What a great show i loved it
",I don't have any word else but this show Deserve the best
341,73,10,1," exciting,shocking episode
",It was a great episode with a lot of exciting things to discover and also a lot of shocking scenes and some character developing in general it was on point
342,73,5,0," Its getting boring - poor script
","The same story is repeating again in this season. A different planet this time with some bad guys hiding in the trees and some good guys, as usual. Killings and more killings. Nothing new!"
343,73,8,1," When the first of the main characters will fall ?
","The Series is nice to watch till now ... I somehow like how the characters try to survive in all of this.
However I am afriad the series, being long, started repeating itself .... they need new contents and not to fall in self-repeating trap.
The question in the title keeps being a mystery"
344,73,10,1," Wow
",This episode was perfect .. my favorite one so far
345,73,9,1," The New Planet.
","The new planet, or - moon -. Is very interesting. The story keep hinting us about mysteries on the planet. Which keeps the story fresh and charming."
346,73,10,1," Best show on tv ever.
",This show is the exact portrait of the human nature. I love the writing. If there wasn't a game of thrones this could be it's replacement.
347,73,8,1," Good episode.
","4 out of 5 stars.The third episode continues with Clarke, Bellamy, and her people meeting the colony that lives on the estranged planet. Learning that their people are divided into factions and are at a civil war. Meanwhile, Octavia motives are questioned by Bellamy. The drama, the story building, and some action is worth watching."
348,73,10,1," THAT WAS AMAZING!!
",Unlike the first two episodes this one was impressive and reminded me of the real (the 100) i was exited after finishing the episode
349,73,10,1," Good

I love this episode it's very great and she answer all my question about this planet"
350,74,10,1," Omg

351,74,9,1," This season is SO good
","I know it's only been 4 episodes, but season 6 is killing it so far, and this episode has really kicked off what I'm hoping will be one of the best, if not the best, season of The 100 so far. The plot is fresh and interesting, but incorporating the mythology and storylines from previous seasons. Really hoping the season continues its strong start!"
352,74,10,1," Best episode so far of what could be the best season of The 100
","I ""discovered"" The 100 back in December of 2017 while browsing through Netflix... and I got hooked immediately, so much that I ended up watching all 4 seasons in a matter of 2 weeks. Then I got to watch Season 5 live and now season 6... but out of all seasons, I am really, really enjoying Season 6! It builds upon all previous seasons and yet it feels so fresh! I love The 100's mythology and the whole Flame-plot line! I really look forward to the rest of the season! My favorite show for sure!"
353,74,10,1," This episode is amazing!!!
",One day later and the ending to this episode still has me shook.
354,74,9,1," Season 6 amazing
","I think there are a lot of moment/memories/reminders they used from season 1 and 2 and that's amazing just to have some moment that you think ; oh that's like s1 and s2 all over again . I dig it.Not the exact same scenes but a reminder and that cool. (My English is bad sorry)
Love it cant wait for next eps."
355,74,10,1," Wow, nobody see that coming unexpected
","Wow, nobody see that coming unexpected so i give it 10/10"
356,74,8,1," Good twist.
",4 out of 5 stars.The episode continues as we learn about the people living on the planet. It may not seem what they expected. There is a twist which ends in a cliffhanger to see were the story will go. Great episode. Less action and more of a story progress.
357,74,8,1," Becca is god, lol.
","Alright, the old man thing is really interesting and I am curious how things will work out there. The problem in this episode is that I just getting sick of the celebration scenes, but that's ok, it's tolerable.Although the episode is great. Continuing the storyline, rising up new mysteries."
358,74,3,0," Plot twists??
","Who are the bots giving out 10s?? I love the show, but sorry the plot twists were surprising back in the earlier seasons. what we have now are plot repeaters. this season ties Sanctum (Mountain Weather), Clarke and the new chip to ALIE, and now led to believe Clark is really dead?? the star of the show, dead?? SMH, within the ending of the season the obvious plot will be Gabriel, (the supposed bad guy like the grounders against the mountain men), after taking over the city of Sanctum will do some mumbo jumbo and remove the chip from Clarke and somehow eradicate an erased mind putting back all memories and VOILA!!! This show is good and I find myself still only watching to see if one of the big 6 die soon..(Like Jaha and Finn die) It's getting repetitive..New planet, new hidden foes/allies, new obstacles..no, not new, just different faces..MM were allies, kill grounders, then Primes good guys kill Gabriels people..then figure it out and fix it then the mind control (Sanctum=City of Light=Mount Weather) (the Flame=Praiya/Lightbourne) (Russell/Sanctum=MountWeather=ALIE/CityofLight)
All in all, same plots and story lines, different characters. Getting old and Season 7 is coming. They better put their thinking caps on because they running out of planets and earth is another 125yrs away. A little too far for a quick drive to see if shes healed herself. Just fast forward thru the fighting to the new alliance with Gabriel and retaking of city of light, err, I mean Sanctum"
359,74,7,0," This season is amazing
",In every time I watched the episodes I think it is the best and finally I love clarcküíûüíû
360,74,3,0," LOL

361,75,8,1," Stromae - Alors On Danse
","Wow, great episode; many modern sci fi shows should take example on The 100 and their capacity to renew their show each season."
362,75,7,0," Turning it Around?
","I haven't liked this season up to this episode. Too similar to season 2. All the new characters are unlikable and the returning characters haven't quite seemed themselves (pun somewhat intended). After a so-so start, I thought the season was going to tailspin after last episode but my hope is restored. Good episode with a gripping second half or so"
363,75,10,1," Really good episode
",Probably the best episode so far this season with episode 2. This episode was just perfect and Eliza Taylor OMG she is queen. 10/10 episode for sure
364,75,10,1," Convergence
","First and foremost, this episode was spectacular. This season has so far done a well job of building suspense and leaving us questioning the actions of characters. Moreover, I was disappointed back when Alli was introduced to the show, I thought it was irrelevant to the show itself. However, NOW that seasons are connecting and we are given more insight, I can't help but take back everything I had said about season 3. The writers, directors, crew, and all of our favorite actors are doing a superb job this year! Finally, I can't wait to see how this journey we're currently on ends and how everything will turn out. Many more questions that we need answers to!"
365,75,10,1," One of the best episodes of the show...
",I dare say it was almost perfect...Everything from the story to the cinematogroahy was excellent.AND GOD DAMN WAS IT INTERESTING.
366,75,8,1," Good 5th episode.
",4 out of 5 stars.The episode continues with Clarke being gone and replaced by Josephine. While trying to go undercover with her people. While her people are discovering a sinister plot with the people.
367,75,9,1," Same content, Different context ! ... Vehicle survive for years
","It is still good, I still love it and hocked to it ... but it is repeating over and over ... same content different context.
I believe the 100 need a science guy ... They have bikes working for hundreds of years ... Clark had a working vehicle last season when she was alone in the world ... the vehicle survive and live for years :O...."
368,75,1,0," The 100 have gone Altered Carbon?
","The first season of this show were quite entertaining, but the producers seem to have run out of ideas and had to borrow some from other shows, e.g. Altered Carbon ( I also see some The Expanse in it ) . The ability to live again in a new body is what Altered Carbon is all about. I wouldn't be surprised to see Joel Kinnaman making a cameo appearance on the show as an inhabitant of the weird planet the hundred are now on under a new ""sleeve""."

Nothing bad happens to the evil characters like Octavia (wannabe child murderer) and Murphy even though he should have died with that blood loss, *snap your fingers* and he is back limping out of the room in the end.Just because so many people ""Love"" Octavia and forgets she wanted to kill a child -Madi.

I just feel like the last episodes feel a bit boring and slow, the whole thing with clarke and the girl ( Joshephine I believe) in the ark which represent the deep consiousness of both feels weird and rather annoying to spend so much time on.Still a huge fan of the show, but the audience need to accept the fact that it is more a drama, than action."

","Good to see Bellamy not go easy on his sister. He's not going to let that go easily.
I'm enjoying Russell Lightborne's character. Not a bad guy without honor, but living with a morally complex situation and striving to survive. JR Bourne really delivers on the complexity of his decision process and I like his look too.
This episode had less silliness and more straight direct situations to contemplate.
Maybe Bob Morley had a big part to play in that with his direction. His acting was really solid this episode.
Lots of interesting directions opened up too. Much better than the last 2-3 episodes."

446,83,6,0," Left hanging
","But not in a good way like last seasons epic finale.
More confusing that cliff hanger, a few open ends for the next series to go in but none seem as big and focused as previous seasons.
Then we've got the army on the ship awake, and a bunch of weird stuff not far enough along to catch a good grasp of.
I'm glad Russell's still on board, He's an interesting character, Madi is back, but where did the flame upload itself to and what does that mean?
Jordan's got something weird going on but we're not given enough information to have a solid idea of what that could mean, very vague.
The ending seemed very rushed and cut off.
Maybe not so much a cliff hanger as simply left hanging."
447,83,10,1," Amazing episode, but not the best finale
","As an episode of the 100, this is really great. One of the best of the season by far, however, ranking against the other finales it feels very rushed and incomplete - it seems to really serve as a lead into season 7 more than anything else."
448,83,9,1," The 100 has done it again!!!
","I can't say that this finale has reached the standards of the previous season's finale,but damn,this episode had it all.Awesome fight scenes, thrilling moments,touching moments and yet another enticing cliffhanger.It isn't as good as most of the show's finales but it is a satisfying way to end a rollercoaster of a season and it paves a way for an even bigger final season.I can't wait for season 7.It will be hard letting a show like this go."
449,83,9,1," Good but noth the best
","It was a really good ending. Even though it has a lot of gaps. Last's season final was one of the best, maybe the best (for me) Its obviously just the transition to the last season. I bet that the last season finale could beat everything."
450,83,4,0," Not this shows best finale
","This show has had some absolutely amazing finales. Unfortunately this was not one of them. I just felt underwhelmed. I'm not going to get into spoilers and all that...but for me, I wasn't really impressed. I enjoyed this season but I guess I was just expecting more...especially after last seasons truly remarkable finale.Still looking forward to next season!!"
451,83,5,0," What the..where's the rest of it?
","I waited a week for episode #14 before realizing this was the season finale. Doh. It was a good episode but terrible as a finale. I feel like I'm being knocked around and I'm not that excited for season 7. I'm sure I'll watch it lol, but come on, don't mess with people like that."
452,83,8,1," Not a bad ending, but ...
","It's a bit too much! There was a lot of pending questions, and we are still waiting for the answers , and at the end there is even more pending questions (what about Jordan? the flame? the anomaly?)
But I loved how O. went back to ""normal"" after all, and the way they handle the situation with Russel. But still they don't really want to chock us, the others ending were more brutal , and more ""wow"".
Can't wait for the final season now ;)"
453,83,7,0," Decent climax.
","3.5 out of 5 stars.The 100 season finale delivers climatic closure to this season which involves Clarke trying to save her people from the primes. It has some thrills. And action. Some fun twists and turns with the characters. I did feel like it rushed on the exposition with some characters like the villain. It does have a cliffhanger ending which is not as surprising and exciting but a little more confusing on where the next season can go.Overall, The 100 season 6 I will rate it 3 out of 5 stars. It may not be the best season in the series. It started out promising with Clarke and her people dealing with their conflict with each other. While being on a strange planet which may not be the peaceful life they were looking for. Coming across a forgettable concept and villain about the primes. The characters are tested again and their loyalties with each other. It has some thrills, action, and emotional moments with the characters which makes this season worth following."
454,83,9,1," Super excited about Season 7 but.
",This episode disappointed me a bit because of the lack of answers in it. Of course it ends most of the storyline but the Anomaly that has been teased for the whole season got no answer. But arise more questions. Sadly we have to wait one year to get the answer.
455,83,1,0," Very Poor Finale
","Awful writing, no answers to the questions proposed during the season, and just an all around boring episode. Not remotely reflective of a season finale at all. I'm glad this show is finishing at season 7, because as a series long fan it's very clear that the show runner has no idea how to craft a story. An all around poor and ill-delivered finale, that I think most stalwart fans of the show would be embarrassed with."
456,83,5,0," things with anomaly is a bad approach in a good way
","It's a things that exist in this moon, and viewer will get more question from it, and as a typical series quality, it's a good approach to attract fans for another season. but i don't think we need more plot for this series and with ""hope"" coming from this anomaly as an adult, it's makes fans goes more in wild imagination, ea "" time travel"" or "" octavia adventure in the anomaly and how long is it"" why you have make more question.
i guess we have to watch season 7."
457,83,6,0," Mehh..
",I love this seriers.. but this for me is the weakest season and the weakest season finale.. i really hope season 7 is way better.
458,83,10,1," Was it the best ending for this season???
","YES, it was. Great ending and amazing acting and excellent details. And very moving episode, (( EVERY WHERE WE GO DEATH HAPPENS)) great and true"
459,83,10,1," Great final! Cant Walt for Season 7
",Season 6 Was a ttest comeback for yje show and the Season final d√∏d not disapoint.
460,83,6,0," Disappointed
","This season failed to break new grounds. It's just a rehash of S1, S2 and s3 how?
First sky crew came down to check whether planet alpha is survivable then they meet the children of Gabriel dressed in camouflage, does that ring any bell? Yes of course in s1 sky crew came from sky to see whether or not earth is survivable and then meet the grounders also dressed in camouflage.
Second, they came across sanctum, a group of civilized people who brainwashed their people into believing they're sacrificing themselves for the greater good but it's actually for benefits of those who called themselves The Primes does that sound familiar? Yes absolutely! In s2 the mountain men, civilized people who can't get out of their bunker because of the radiation and the only way is to extract people's bone marrow with or without permission.
Third the whole chipping people thing in this season, where the primes can live endlessly by sticking their mind drives into people's neck has already been done in s3 by A.L.I.E. the storylines are somewhat similar in some way. I just wish they drop this whole A.L.I.E thing and Becca praimheda and the Madi Commander thing, they're just annoying but they keep dragging it.
I'm happy they let some characters die tho like Abby, Kane etc their deaths was long overdue. Jordan is useless and I don't see any reason for him to be there. His love angle sucked, it almost bored me to death. Most of the old characters felt somewhat not needed in this season, I'm looking at you Raven, Miller, emori etc they are just there for the sake of being......there. Echo was pretty badass in the season tho, I like her. Clarke as Josephine was entertaining but after sometime she started to be annoying.Well, I'm not even thrilled for s7."
461,84,5,0," I'm over Clarke
","It's hard to invest in her character when she doesn't seem to have any redeeming qualities. It seems like the decisions she makes are always what she wants without any disregard to others (despite the show making it seem like it's for her people). The end of this episode proves that.In season 6 episode Raven tells her off very accurately (""...The only difference between you and her is Octavia doesn't pretend to feel bad about it."") and it felt very satisfying. That moment was set up beautifully for Clarke to feel remorse and apologize in some way. Now it's season 7 and I'm still waiting for her to apologize to Raven, lol. All of season 6 most of the characters hated Clarke, but we never got any moment of resolve. Other character's did with other characters, but none with Clarke which is very frustrating.Season 6 gave Octavia the redemption story that Clarke's character desperately needed. Believe me, I wanted to root for Clarke's character, but because the show runner's haven't given me any depth to the decisions that Clarke makes other than she's just selfish makes it hard for her to be likable."
462,84,10,1," Best premiere of the 100
",The beginning was really peaceful to look at but when we got closer to the end everything went wild and is was extremely good ! üî•
463,84,10,1," THE BEGINNING OF THE END!!!
","I had a strong feeling the 100 won't fail after the previous season finale.This isnt the hype talking this episode has managed to surpass that in a phenomenal final season premiere.I saw that the episode count is 16 so if the 100 are bringing 15 more of THIS,they better release it all at once because I don't think I have the energy to wait for 4 or 5 months.The crew is bringing in their best performances yet.A great war is yet to come,and I'm already anxious as to how it will end.Bring on the rest of season 7."

First they thought they were the last of the human race on the ark then boom the grounders, the grounders thought they were the last of the human race then boom the mountain men, then all of them together thought they were the last of the human race then boom the eligius prisoners, they still thought they were the last of the human race then boom the COB and the sanctum people and now they thought all together they are the last of the human race then boom the anomaly 'invisible' people. Stop thinking about the last of the human race 'cause there seem to be people out there one way or the other.Why are they ruining Clarke's character arc again? It's not good for the show to have an unlikable lead character not when it's In the series finale. I'm more interested in the anomaly storyline. Hope is well casted."

472,84,8,1," Not what I expected
","Meh. Thats all i can say for my expectations and in the other hand what ive seen.
I dont say it was bad. Im just saying that because this is the last season of the100 we need to see some action, drama and good old thriller like the last seasons. But this episode didn't include any of what ive mentioned. It was actually a bit boring. Hope episode 2 will be better."
473,84,6,0," Kind of a boring start for the final season
",(3 out of 5 stars).The first episode is a bit decent. Clarke decisions are questionable. A new threat is on the horizon. I just feel like the script is a bit lazy writing with the lack of development. The new characters are dull. Kind of forgettable.

","The entire crew and cast keeps on setting my emotions and expectations on high. Wow. Eliza Taylor in this episode gave us an incredible performance. This was also bittersweet cuz it's the beginning of the end, but my god it was amazing.New world, same problems."

","I'm not a fan of the beginning of season 7 so far. I really enjoyed watching seasons 1 to 5, the 6th was allright. They really went all out Science Fiction. I've read it here and will say it as well. I want to see the existing cast to be in the spotlight, and not see new main characters, mainly because I don't think Hope's acting is that great.
I hope the rest of the season will make up for it."
482,85,4,0," Slower start of the season

Even she's wearing the ""alien suit"" it seemed pretty impossible to me.I like hope, gab,and echo part much better. Echo decision at end makes kinda loathe her character a bit tho.

526,88,8,1," More than a little hard to follow
","The action in this episode is great and it certainly fills in a few of the blanks from season six (and to an extent, this season as well). My problem with it is all the time jumps and action taking place in different areas where time moves at different rates. This necessitates a nonlinear narrative, and whoo boy is this episode nonlinear. Perhaps when I go back and rewatch older episodes everything will make a little more sense but it's hard with only onscreen cues like ""PLANET BARDO - 35 DAYS AGO"" to place what happened before this scene, what happened after, and how what we're about to watch informs the actions of either of those.So it's good; it certainly introduces some exciting new characters (and a new setting). You just might have to take notes while watching."

","This should of ended after season 4; but hey I get it, I would enjoy it to if i was 12, and that is the target audience!
Its unbelivable (and not in a cool way) totally not interesting, even if it ever was. When i think of all the sweet and awesome series that where cancelled and this... is still on, ahahahaha... JUST KILL ME.
Characters are going through arcs that someone before them already has, in the exact same way. Every amazing theme, twist and storyline, was riped off from a classic and ORIGINAL SF novels, movies and series....
And this last season is just making my point, but I guess U realy must love it looking at the other comments.
My advice, read a book or watch a movie from the 90s and you will see that somebody EWERYBODY has done it before ""the 100"", and what a stupid name for a show, it lost the meaning after the first episode!!!"

It just doesn't make sense for her to be really perturbed by it.I like Diyoza and Hope conversation much better. I like Russell (sheidheda) and Murphy's scenes too."

",(2.5 out of 5 stars).The cast is great. But this episode is slow with its story development.

","This episode is somehow one of the best in the series, in my opinion. The fact that in 40 minutes they managed to create such a developed backstory for these characters is incredible and honestly leaves you wanting more. It really feels like it has the 100 spirit with it (which some backdoor pilots lack) and honestly if it was a stand alone show (not affiliated with the 100) it would be a really strong pilot.The characters were brilliantly written, the acting was on point and the storyline was beyond clever (bonus points for tying into the main plot so well), really worth a watch and hopefully it gets picked up!"
543,91,10,1," AMAZING WE NEED THE PREQUEL
",This show never fails to keep me on the edge of my seat and it would be a mistake to not air the prequel. This prequel will give us so many answers to our looming questions. It will also give us the chance to understand the grounders and even the original people on the Ark as well. The 100 has been incredible and Jason Rothenburg has never failed to excite the fans and up his game year after year. I can only beg and hope that we get the chance to see this universe again in the Prequel it would be such an amazing show and not one I'd want to miss out on.

545,91,10,1," Amazing Episode. WE WANT THE 100 PREQUEL!!
","Initially, this series felt like it has explored everything there is to explore: earth is gone, and the stories on the other planets are wrapping up. However, after watching this episode, I realised that there was a whole new world to be explored, in the form of a prequel. This episode is so amazing and is literally shot like a high budget movie. In its short 40 minutes of screen time, it has managed to answer all the questions that we had since Season 1, with an interesting storyline and wonderful acting, cinematography, and directing. So many things, stories and issues that have been established in the past few seasons such as the very existence of the grounders or how the language trigedaslang was formed was explained, and everything literally comes full circle. Clearly, there is still so much to explore in the 100 world; the grounders, disciples, arkers, mountain men and the early eligius missions. All these stories can be shown, and may even be intertwined to make the series even more enjoyable. This episode is probably the best or if not second best episode in the entire show (behind the season 5 finale).
I'm sure that the prequel will be amazing, so i really hope it gets picked up. Please pick it up! #WeWantThe100Prequel"

565,92,2,0," Great episode, but still irrelevant
","The one thing that the 100 has done perfectly over the past 6 seasons is character developments. The main characters have had so many ups and downs and sometimes we did hate some of them but overall we love them no matter what and frankly they are the only thing that make the 100 a great show.In this season, however, after 9 episodes we haven't seen any of them do anything amazing yet. I mean, we want Clarke, Bellamy, raven, or Octavia to at least be a part of something in this final battle. Speaking of which, we dont even know exactly what it is and just hear the bardo people talk about it.I believe the storyline of season 7 is brilliant in general but they have somehow failed to show it in the amusing ways they used to. It took me 9 episodes to be interested in the sanctum storyline which could have been wonderful from the start. And the bardo storyline is starting to piss me off. I need answers. I hope they dont uncover everything only in the final two episodes. Especially Bellamy's plot.All in all, I still love the show and believe it is one the greatest ones I've ever seen. I just hope they dont mess up the series finale and the next 7 episodes be much greater than what we expect."

571,93,7,0," I really hope this is a comment on modern politics
","Cos if it's not then it's just a silly plot.
I'm finding it hard to digest the constant barrage of slayings by our heroes. It's non stop and the easy answer to every single situation, and a little bit boring, with only a few episodes to go. Maybe that's the moral of this story. The 'good guys' never learn, never find a better way. That's a good metaphor for modern day USA, in which case this is fantastic script writing, but if it's not that then....."

573,93,10,1," What a great episode
",7b is going to awesome thats all i can say great episode really
574,93,9,1," Offers a little story development, could be better.
","The main problem here is that story develops just a little bit than the last episode. The main event is just a short-term story goal that feels unnessessary and unrevelant. But although despite everything that I just said, the episode is just great. Good acting and an intense screenplay."
575,94,8,1," Still Too Much Story Left To Tell
","I can only conclude that the writers want to tell much more than the amount of episodes left to do that, which isn't a bad thing in itself... but it's left me feeling a little worried about how the show will end. This was a good episode, I wish they had focused more on the Bardo storyline earlier on, instead of running into so many directions."
576,94,10,1," Lest we forget Bellamy...
","This show still takes my breath away. Bellamy Jon Snow Blake is back, and it is much more interesting than you could ever expect.
10/10"
577,94,7,0," Weeks in a forest, and he doesn't build a ladder
","Great to see Bob Morley back with some screen time. He's an enjoyable actor to watch and immediately lifted his scenes.
That slippery rock wall that was 2 men high eh? insurmountable, .......... If only there was wood and rope to make a ladder. Ok that wouldn't have helped that much in the long run as they needed 2 people to complete the journey.
Too bad the person who loves everyone equally decided to start off their stay by instigating a fight that left them both badly beaten just to get it to stop. Maybe that's the point of this show. A parallel to battling factions on earth who continually make the wrong choices to create different paths to the easiest peaceful one, but that wouldn't make a very interesting show, or would it?So Bellamy doesn't make a ladder and he reads the cults manual and does a little bit of prey pray, and it does achieve something. We're not sure what. I'm not seeing Bellamy's betrayal as going full traitor, more cutting the crap and moving things forward. The Shepherd isn't necessarily evil, he isn't going around killing 'our team' in the way they are knocking off his team, he just has a different objective.I don't know about the kneeling to the shepherd thing, I wasn't sold on that. Bellamy can acknowledge the other teams validity without going full on religious nutter. Hopefully that's not the character path that's been written for him.
I like that Shepherd Bill is written as a normal guy with different insight and a lot of info 'our team' don't have. hopefully it will play out in a way that isn't all about killing people. I'm a bit bored with that answer to every question, but maybe that's the point of the show. 'our team is the US and all it's military 'solutions' that leave many dead and nothing solved, and Team US oblivious to it's mistakes that it keeps repeating over and over. Bit depressing really, but, relevant."

582,96,2,0," Disrespectful
","I never would have thought that the showrunner would actually stop telling the story he's been writing for 7 seasons because of personal issues against an actor but here we are.I decided last year that I wouldn't watch season 7 before the entire season is out, so I can decide based off of peoples reaction whether to bother or not. But I could not stay away from spoilers all the time and all I heard was outrage. Male lead erased from promotion, main characters sidelined for new characters and guest stars, all the main focus on the prequel while ignoring the actual show that is still airing and now this episode.If a showrunner can't stay professional in order to give the show, actors, characters and fans the respect they deserve after 7 years of dedicating their life to keeping this show on air then they shouldn't work in television in the first place.Now I have to agree to different articles about this show that the 100 will go down as one of the most disappointing final seasons of all time next to game of thrones."
583,96,1,0," DISGUSTED
","This episode was the nail in the coffin for this season and show. This season sucked beyond recognition, none of the characters were well written and it all shows in the work created by a vindictive narcissist (Jason Rothenberg). He Treats staff terribly and actors that work with him say how he is openly racist. Good luck trying to secure the prequel ""Anaconda"". You were too caught up into getting that off the ground that you tanked your currently airing show. All for spite. His previous writers have even said he does these things out of spite to his fans for demanding too much from the show. Endless plot holes and useless parallels. Two main lead characters had so much chemistry, their real life actors got married. And you spited them for it. The CW needs to take a good look at J.R and consider FIRING him as soon as 7x16 finishes. Took one of the best and most creative shows concept wise, something that was never done before and completely dismantled it. Good job."

","Seven years of build up only to trash the entire show in one episode. I won't be watching the rest of the series, let alone the prequel, anything made with Jason's name attached, or anything at all from the CW"
590,97,2,0," Almost unwatchable
","This was really hard to watch. I don't get it, I thought Jason would use the little time he has left wisely, but boy, I was wrong.
This is not just about Bellamy , the overall episode seemed very disconnected and an overall waste of time. All those reunion moments that were probably meant to spark some emotions with the viewers, just rang hollow to me. Nobody cares really, at this point in the game nearing the end of the season, it's not time for another filler episode.
It's hard for me to comprehend some of the 10/10 reviews from some of the people here. Have we been watching the same episode? How can you possibly think this episode deserves a 10/10? We are rating this episode, not the whole show, otherwise my score would also be higher as the 100 had its glory moments but it just looks like they are all gone.To make things worse, Clarke is getting more annoying and overbearing with every scene, I've gotten to the point where I'm almost rooting for Madi to die already just to see her suffer in her selfishness.I was also expecting to see some genuine mourning of Bellamy's death, that would have given him a fraction of the recognition he deserves, instead most characters just seem to get over it in a few seconds time, and the ones that don't just don't seem very genuine, there's a hollow feel about their reactions. Just the fact that they accept his death so easily, as something necessary, seems off to me.Clarke's justification of killing Bellamy was laughable ""I tried everything!"" What exactly did you try Clarke? ""I aimed for the heart"" Also, where is the book you killed him for? ""Oops, I left it behind anyway"". Somehow nobody thought to ask about the book.This being said, good effort from the actors to keep things together and try to make this still look like a good show. Good acting, bad writing, it is the writing that I'm rating here essentially. Such a shame, the actors deserve better. Still hoping for a miracle in the last to episodes to save this dying show!"
591,97,1,0," It's going worst
","I thought that the ending of 7x13 was the worst thing they could do but i was wrong. The reactions of the other charachters is even worse.

Nothing has changed. 2 minutes and it's like it never happened.

","I started this show early last year, binged all the way through S6 and started watching weekly for S7. I feel like something happened in the writing department because the lack of continuity and storytelling is abysmal; character development, relationships, and arcs have been shred to pieces... I thought final seasons were love letters to the fans in most shows? Guess not in this one. Erasure of main characters is also very odd."

","They didn't want a good ending. They are killing good people a lot. Take a look at agent of shield final season, everyone is happy with it. It's great, but this season of the 100 doesn't feels like it's the last. And Clarke is like the queen... See all the people in sanctum is going war over a child."
598,97,1,0," This isn't just about Bellamy.
","Are Bellamy and Clarke my favorite characters, yes. Did I watch just for them, no. I STARTED the show because of Bellamy and Clarke, but I stayed because I fell in love with Octavia and Raven and even Murphy. I'm ranking this low, not just because ""my precious Bellamy is gone"", I'm ranking it low because none of these characters feel like the characters I fell in love with, the story isn't what I fell in love with. I know everyone that is part of this god forsaken show wants to make it about a romantic relationship or a character, but it's so much more than that. This is NOT the show I fell in love with."

People don't think anymore with their own brains."
605,97,2,0," downhill all season
","Some people here who would give the episode 10/10 are apparently only doing it for balancing the hate because based off of their reviews they seem to think that bellamys death is the only thing that is causing bad reviews. And it's not even hard to guess who those people are.
As far as i'm concerned the entire season has been going downhill since episode 1. Sure there were better episodes and a great prequel episode but there is no denying that this is not where this show was heading when they still had a plan.
This episode was just another filler, where they were stuck on earth because of another stupid decision that seems to be the theme of this season. And the ending of the episode that made the last episodes ending completely pointless as if we didn't know that already. That just shows the decision had no impact on the story or apparently even the characters as it turns out.
I'm not even going to get into the continuous disrespect of the male lead, where they still continue to villainize him after his real death."

607,98,1,0," Not The 100 I knew. Disappointed,heartbrokenüíî
","In a final season, one final journey there was so much to wrap things out. Most important characters, to have final solidarity even in death but then what happened? Yes! This show never meant to be happy ending stuff which was also a good thing about the show. It was all about surviving and not knowing what enemy they will face next but among everything, fighters will fight, leaders will lead the spirit to survive. And Leaders means Clarke Griffin and Bellamy Blake. Yes if anyone says to me Bellamy wasn't a leader I will punch their face so hard they will see stars in their eyesüôÑ Bellamy Blake was the first one to being a rebel, he was the one who inspired people to stick together though at first it had a stupid reason but then he took everyone, taught them to how to fight, gave pep talk whenever or whoever needed that, most of all to Clarke. She might be the first one to recognized him as not a murderer but her doubtful decisions always came into light because she had Bellamy by her side. In this season when it was meant to be one last fight the war and they gave us some backstories, some delusional theories about all mankind sake, a stupid Sheidheda story, divided the cast members to different planets, in different time slots, struggling their way back to each other and bla bla bla but gosh!! Where is our the 100 team? That team who always finds ways to survive by planning, plotting, and solving puzzles together? Not just Bellamy and Clarke, I mean everyone doing their part, with agreements, disagreement, even doubting each other but still sticking around for friends because they were the 100's team. They were friends. They were family. All I saw in this season broken characters, every character I knew acted differently than other reasons. Story holes were big so big that they threw Bellamy to into it. Clarke our head who always acted rationally acted emotionally damaged one and killed her best friend. Octavia who for 10 years every day tried to escape the Skyrim just to meet her brother and tell him that she finally understands goes in vein when she said to Clarke that ""SHE UNDERSTAND"" Echo who was so mad for Bellamy being dead and tried to kill everyone in Bardo also understand Clarke. Little Madi who bore the burden of Bellamy's death on her sakes and Gabriel's death too made her take the drastic step to willingly to Bardo to die only. So, Bellamy died for nothing? No one believed him maybe he was delusional but if they forgave Octavia being bloodrina then why not Bellamy being delusional? They didn't mourn for him. They simply ignored the fact who Bellamy actually was before that. Didn't even give him farewell. Emori being tortured, Murphy being hurt too much darkness in it. My favourite show just got ruined."

Instead we are left with many... MANY plot holes, with a rushed faux happy ending that loses it's charm the more you think about.The HEART of the show was really missing this season, especially in this episode.
