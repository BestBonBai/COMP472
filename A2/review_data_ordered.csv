849,72,1,0,A disappointing ending I hope Season 8 will be filmed again
308,21,6,0,"Last night, the relentless, unforgiving slog of story reminded me of the Night's Watch's torturous death march toward The Wall."
612,50,4,0,"This show is really going downhill. Almost nothing is working good in this 6th season premiere. The script is more and more unlikely and illogical. Sansa and Theon obviously got to make that huge jump from the wall unharmed. Then Sansa, North's blood, is afraid of a cold river while Ramsey's dogs are barking behind her. Bolton hounds magically disappear the precise instant they find Sansa. Then Brienne arrives, who easily save the day by killing off all the (6? 7? 8?) Bolton soldiers. Dorne is still cartoonish and pointless. As a remedy for the lack of agency shown by prince Doran versus the Lannisters (who had killed some beloved members of Martell family), they decide to kill all the remaining line of the Martells. After such an unlikely coup, they clearly plan to move at war against the Lannisters, in order to avenge some of the Martells (Elia and Oberyn, who actually died in a trial by combat). Seriously? The circumstances of the coup are completely insane and not worthy mention. The killing of Trystane was also ridiculous. Where are those two sandsnakes coming from? A boat sneaking unseen in King's Landing harbor, out of nowhere? The confrontation inside the ship, with Trystane's death, is very badly executed, with a ridiculous final sentence by one of the snakes (""Greedy pussy"", the bar hasn't got much higher since the ""bad pussy"" line fro season 5). Roose Bolton speech, fearing for the Lannisters to come against the North, was pointless: the issue definitely should have been arisen before. At the Wall: Ghost's howling, just a few minutes after the murdering, immediately summons Davos and the other guys (who couldn't hear any noise during the lengthy ""for the watch"" sequence, but suddenly run at Ghost's howl). Jon's friends are all at once gathered, and no one else, around Jon's corpse. They immediately know they are the only few loyal brothers. They don't ever bother attending the general meeting. The public explanation for Lord Commander's killing was weak and definitely unconvincing, since the wildlings had already come in. What was Jon's murder aimed to avoid, at that point? What was supposed to be the plan? Taking the wildlings back beyond the Wall? Calling northern houses to engage a battle against the wildlings sitting in the Gift? Weak, pointless plan. And what the hell are Davos, Edd and the other guys doing with Jon's corpse? Are they barricaded to defend Jon's dead body? Why on earth? Because they are expecting him to resurrect? Never heard of anything like that as a reaction to someone's death. Never. In Essos too, everything looks messy: where did Drogon end up? Vanished into nothing? The entire horde with thousands of Dothraki couldn't see him? How come the entire fleet is burnt in a few seconds? Was it left unguarded? But what's worse is that many of the dialogs are dull and boring, uninteresting. The pace is boring. This is the long awaited first episode and already many scenes sound like fillers. The charm, the subtlety and the brilliancy of the first seasons is gone. No confidence in what's coming."
614,50,1,0,"Where the hell were Davos and Jon's friends at the time of his death? They didn't hear anything? REALLY?Bolton's men destroyed Stannis' camp last season but couldn't fight Brienne and Pod? Really?Sand Snakes killing Doran, Areo Hotah and Trystane and that's fine? Where are the dornish army? REALLY?With the Martell now extinct, who is going to rule Dorne? Bastards? REALLY?Martell is the second family to be completely extinct by the producers. We've already said goodbye to Baratheons.Daenerys keeps getting ""special writing treatment"". Do you really think a horde of dothraki would do nothing to her only because she was Drogo's wife? OK then.That Melisandre scene. Unnecessary. The old clichê of the beautiful witch who is actually an old hag.There is no ""game of thrones"" anymore. No political schemes. No conspiracy. The game is over. And it got replaced with an awful fan-fiction."
616,50,1,0,"The 'Sand Snakes' alone brought this episode down completely. The writers seem to be pandering to the lowest common denominator with numerous short scenes where little of consequence happens, and the favourite characters banter back and forth with cringe worthy dialogue. It is clear that HBO producers don't expect their audience to understand anything subtle or interesting at all, and so have reduced the formula to: people die, people copulate, people have short vapid exchanges. The only way they could redeem the show for me now is for the next episode to be a 60 minute sequence of the Sand Snakes being hung, drawn and quartered in vivid detail."
617,50,1,0,"With 6.1 Game of Thrones has officially gotten to the point where I feel like everything has screeched to a halt. The first few seasons of the show were some of the best television ever made, and with S5 and from the looks of the first episode of this season the formula is getting stale. We get 40 minutes per episode of nothing happening followed by 5 minutes of mediocre ending with 2 minutes of excellent. With only 1 good episode per season since 4 I'm beginning to feel like watching this show is nothing but a chore. Not to mention the glaring continuity errors and plot holes this one episode had. Game of Thrones, you used to be good. What happened?"
572,45,1,0,"I did not like the change in Sansa's story line at all! Maybe they wanted to make her story more interesting but they failed at that, I believe. What happened to Sansa was completely unnecessary, like she hasn't had enough! Why should she endure this? To become stronger? Utter crap! I'd suggest to the writers to stick to the books and not to make such drastic changes to the events!The fighting scene of the sand snakes was horrible as well, very poorly done, it felt like they did not even rehearse the battle choreography or something. The only thing I liked was the progress in Arya's story. Nothing else.What has happened to them this season? Are they in a hurry to wrap it up?"
571,45,4,0,"one of worst and poorest episodes of GOT. battle scene between prince O'Brien's girls and king slayer was super terrible, very poor very low quality and so far from GOT's class.the ending scene of episode completed the misery. the only way writer knows to make show great and attractive is to shock people with torturing scenes of characters which they like, characters that have more humanity, more kindness and in overall good humans! this way worked at first, with executing Ned stark and killing rob stark, but not anymore! why we should watch sansa (an innocent poor kind girl!) get raped by a crazy psycho bastard and hear her whines? should we enjoy this scene?does always seeing good people go to misery makes a movie great ?"
734,62,1,0,"I don't know what to say about got anymore, every episode it gets more Hollywood clichés. So much things were mistaken. Dialogs were amateur. Its not linked to book anymore but can someone explain how can someone lead to kings landing without passing dragonisland, and probably they invented teleportation. Fleet appears suddenly on casterly rock. they don't even look at the map. so many irrational events. Many great wars happened in three episodes and none of them makes any sense How can you defeat highgarden??Just look at the map of GoT. Hopefully some of the screenwriter sees but looks like its too late.. Of course there are a lot of eyecandies and super quotes but...."

128,7,7,0,"""The Pointy End,"" the show's best episode since its fifth and probably its best so far, was the first episode of the show that created that never once made me think, ""Eh, I preferred that in the book."""
130,7,6,0,"Ned is imprisoned and only has about three minutes of screen time in this episode, so you would guess that the show suddenly gets boring, right? Hell no, Robb is Lord Stark now and boy, is he badass in this episode. This is the first time that he really gets to be a major character and he owns absolutely every single scene he's in. We can expect one of them to die in the season finale (maybe both, but I sincerely hope not) and Richard Madden's intriguing performance as Robb managed to make me root more for him than for Ned. Catelyn finally getting together with at least parts of her family was also great to see and the scene with Robb and her was utterly fascinating. And while the Winterfell story part was clearly paramount in 'The Pointy End', most of the other locations were entertaining as well. Despite the huge events at the end of the last episode, King's Landing isn't that much in the fore as I'd expected it to be which is not generally a bad thing because even those scenes dragged a bit from time to time, so I think I would've only been bored with more scenes there. Lena Headey's turn was once again absorbing to watch and Jack Gleeson also gets more and more interesting, but I just feel that his character has way too little screen time to really let the audience get to know him. One crucial moment in this episode was Tyrion encountering his father Tywin for the first time to be seen on the show while having a lot of grubby companions coming with him. Their conversation wasn't as interesting as I'd hoped it to be, mostly because there wasn't anything new being discussed in the scene. In the end, Peter Dinklage proved once again to be a hugely talented actor and Charles Dance also did a very fine job as his evil daddy, the plot just wasn't that juicy.The weakest scenes of this episode were happening at either the Night's Watch or at whatever place the Dothraki scenes are taking place. Unnecessary supporting characters are being introduced again and there are some serious acting problems to be found. Even though George R. R. Martin, the author of the novels that are the basis for the series, wrote this episode, I feel like it isn't exactly how it was meant to be. Some important scenes last for too short, some less important scenes get too much time. I always feel like they don't use all the potential they've got."
409,29,6,0,"Actually,This is the type of episode which should convince you to read the books...Come on! 2000 pages in 12 months: you can do that! Pros: - you won't have to wait for any plot or surprise week after week - you'll deeper dive into Westeros myths & legends (e.g. Rhaegar named for the 1st time in this episode!) - honestly, seeing the TV show + reading the book will open your eyes on how the story is settled down by the authorCons: - still 2 other books to wait ==> potentially 6000 pages in total! (so your next 1-2 years reading)!;-)"
407,29,3,0,"... and a truly dismal finale to the season. If you've seen Red Wedding and haven't seen Mhysa yet do yourself a favor and just skip it to avoid the let down as you'll gain absolutely no new information, story lines aren't advanced in any way with this episode and the gritty parts of the series, the sex and violence, that have become a trade mark of what has been a unique and entertaining series to this point, are utterly gratuitous, pointless and without merit.The most disappointing part of this episode might be the continuing irrelevance and diminishing significance of one of the best storyline and characters in the series, that of Daenerys Targaryen and her dragons. With each episode less time has been devoted to her and when she does appear, as in this episode, it seems to have no importance what so ever and her dialog is beginning to border on silly. Her appearance here seems to be little more than an after thought.There seem to be a lot of fanboy types marking this episode up and giving it glowing reviews but don't believe them. Amongst the friends, family and co-workers which my wife and I talk about this show on a regular basis there's been universal disappointment with the episode especially as the season finale.So much so that I can't help but wonder if HBO and the show's producers didn't inflict a mortal wound on the series with this disaster. We won't see another installment until 2014 and our own sentiment is reflected in the answer to the question we've asked of everyone we've talked with; what are you looking forward to next season and the answer to a person is, nothing.This all seems very reminiscent of the progression of Battlestar Galactica, a terrible season 3 ending that left fans wanting, an extended period of time until the next season premiere in which people stopped caring and then the end."
728,62,3,0,"Starting with season 6, this TV show became just a TV show with rushed scenario, cliché dialogues and easy to predict events. Song of Ice and Fire's success was no-rush, creative and very hard to predict, personalized stories. Especially with this last episode, it's easy to see how the quality had dropped to the level of a ""just an American TV show"". There is no space/time concept anymore, everything is happening in a rush, no logic at all. It's like all these locations are next to each other and anybody can go anywhere any time. Thousands of ships of navies are clashing and being destroyed, HighGarden has fallen in a few hours (which is supposed to be the richest and has a big army), Jon Snow is being teleported from The Wall to Dragonstone...HBO is just eating the fruits of first 5 seasons which were based on well thought, well written books, not some TV scenarist."
567,45,7,0,"Arya is tested by Jaqen H'ghar in the House of Black and White and he tells that she is ready to become someone else. Tyrion and Jorah have a conversation about Daenerys and Jorah's father and how he was murdered by his own men; out of the blue, they are captured by pirates and turned into slaves. Little Finger stumbles with Lancei in King's Landing and has a meeting with Cersei and he plots against Stannis Baratheon and the Bolton. Jamie and Bronn are riding in Dornes and they meet Myrcella; however they need to fight against the Sand Snakes. Lady Olenna meets with Cersei to discuss the future of Loras Tyrell. He is judged by the High Sparrow and Margaery Tyrell is involved and arrested with her brother to a formal trial. Sansa marries Ramsay Bolton and he humiliates her. ""Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken"" is one of the weakest episodes of ""Game of Thrones"". Arya used to be one of my favorite characters; however her segment in the House of Black and white is boring. Little Finger is annoying with Machiavellian schemes against everyone that is powerful making the viewer lost about his true intentions. Cersei's plots are also annoying. I did not read the book, but the last scene with the humiliation of Sansa by Ramsay seems to be totally unnecessary. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken"""
624,52,7,0,"A good episode by any standard. Yet clearly falls short of the soaring bar GOT has raised until now. The absurd, overly-choreographed fight scene between a younger Eddard Stark and foes, complete with cliched banter, reeks of pure cheese. And the High Sparrow story arc is still as bewildering as ever: how exactly this faith group managed to rob the crown of its power so completely and for so many episodes simply doesn't make sense. Why do Cersei and the small council sit idly by while the sparrows run rough shod over the established order? Why is no one counseling Tommen to eliminate them? I hope that GOT resolve these frustrating inconsistencies soon."
566,45,4,0,"My least favorite game of Thrones episode. While some parts of this episode are okay, it is dragged down by the poor writing and directing in Dorne, in addition to the horrible shot at the end of the episode. The remaining scenes of this episode aren't enough to make it even mediocre.Mylod really performed poorly here, failing entirely to create suspension in the fight scene, nor make any of the scenes emotional or believable.Not a good episode of GoT. Possibly the worst.4/10 - Poor"
565,45,7,0,"When Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken aired on HBO, fans of the show and the book series hated it for being more brutal and disturbing in comparison to the previous episodes. What's worse it that it received a 58% rating on Rottentomatoes. Ouch. However, I think that this is a pretty good episode. But before I can give it some praise, there are some problems I have with it.In the previous episodes, the dialog was mostly good despite how slow the plot progression has gotten, but it's sad to say that the dialog here is really weak. It came across as too violent and disturbing particularly the ending sequence where Ramsay Bolton rapes Sansa Stark which came across as really unnecessary (which was the only reason why it received such controversy) and made me felt sorry for her. The second and third problems are the script and plot progression. The script does have some fine moments, but it lacks the spark that made the previous episodes (not to mention the previous seasons) so great. Also, the story did little to advance the story-arcs for the Lannister and Stark characters.However, despite those flaws, everything else turned out OK. The performances, despite how weak the dialog was, are still good, the scenery, sets and costumes are still gorgeous, the music score from Ramin Djawadi is still fabulous and suited the atmospheric tone in some of the scenes really well, the directing is really good, and the editing is even more sharper this time around.So, overall, Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken is by far the weakest episode of the entire season, but in spite of it's problems, it's still pretty good. :)"
570,45,7,0,"First 4 seasons I couldn't wait to watch the next episode, this season I couldn't care more. I was waiting for the story to build up, but 6 episodes have passed and - nothing. We used to gasp at the events, discuss the reasons behind actions, bet on what would happen next. To me this show represented real life - brutal, sudden, dark... with a few decent human beings among ruthless beasts.Yes, I felt bad for some of the events, but I was not watching GOT to feel bad, I was watching it to feel the life in it. What I see now are cheesy scenes and pitiful events, nothing more. To me, it became more like a lot of other shows just in different costumes. We just cancelled our subscription to HBO Now as we had it only to watch this show."
723,61,3,0,"Again, this has not improved. Boring, slow and without emotion and not surprising at all.The first episode I did not like, but this one has been worse than the previous one.Maybe my expectations are higher than the reality, but for me it's a shame that a good television program is getting worse at times.I hope that in the ones that are still to be broadcast they will introduce more emotion, surprises and intrigue, with something more vitality in the characters, as it happened in seasons 1, 2, 3 and 4."
747,64,5,0,"The fan theories floating around are more developed when they are leaked and I think the director/writer should respect the audience's IQ. Alan Taylor who directed some episodes of Season 1 and 2 should be bought back in the helm. His direction was fantastic and I still remember him, can't say if the North remembers him or not!After Joffrey's fate, the series is going in a downhill. The library reading session was quite lame and boring. Every character is travelling like they are using a helicopter. Come on writers, everything seems a bit rushed and forced!With the concentration on narrative, we're left with an outing that can't help but feel like it's lacking where it really counts. In short, old wine in a new bottle!"
750,64,5,0,"Came to 'Game of Thrones' fairly late in the game and due to being so busy the binge-watching was gradual. Have found myself truly loving the show, very quickly becoming one of my favourites. It totally lives up to the hype and not only does it do the brilliant source material justice (a rarity in television) it is on its own merits one of the finest, most addictive and consistently compelling shows in recent years and quality-wise it puts a lot of films in recent years to shame.After such a magnificent previous episode in ""The Spoils of War"", it is understandable that fans would want the next episode to be good or as worthy, even if it wasn't as good or a masterpiece (both of which a tall order seeing as such high quality is difficult to equal or surpass). Unfortunately, ""Eastwatch"" turned out to be a major disappointment. Not just the worst episode of the seventh season, but also for me the worst episode since Season 6's ""No One"" and one of my least favourite 'Game of Thrones' episodes. It's not terrible, it's actually watchable but for a show as great as 'Game of Thrones' watchable is not good enough.""Eastwatch"" certainly has good things. Visually, it looks amazing, as one would expect for 'Game of Thrones'. The scenery is throughout spectacular, the sets are hugely atmospheric and beautiful on the eyes with a real meticulous eye for detail and the costumes suit the characters to a tee. The make-up is beautifully done. As well the cinematography and editing, which are cinematic quality as well, while the special effects are among the best of the latter season episodes.One cannot not mention the thematically, orchestrally and atmospherically multi-layered music scoring and the unforgettable main theme. Again, worthy of a high-budget fantasy/action/drama film. The acting is, considering the material, quite good, though no tour-De-force performances. Lena Headey and Peter Dinklage come off best, concerning Dinklage though it is very difficult to get a bad performance from him. A reasonable job is done setting things up and putting things into place. There are minor revelations, such as Gendry's return, and some nice reunions. As well as some good attention to character interaction, such as Arya and Sansa, with Cersei being the most interesting character here.However, there are disappointing elements which generally have been covered already. There are no real surprises or shocks, the biggest revelations are not huge and not leaving-one-floored-like. Other episodes do a much better job advancing characters and progressing the story in general. There are moments here but not enough. It all feels rather bland, lacking the fire-blazing intensity of ""The Spoils of War"". ""Eastwatch"" is far too rushed, making events feel choppy and jumpy. Too much of the story is not developed e nough and borders on the implausible. Tyrion's plan agreed especially, easily the most absurd and lacking-in-consistency-and-logic story he's had and such an interesting character is much better than this. For a show whose scripts are generally thought-provoking, layered, passionate and sensitive, the writing here majorly disappoints and actually the complete opposite. Here the writing is forced, repetitive, bland, simplistic and far from subtle. The character writing has been far meatier, nuanced and complex.Overall, watchable but hugely disappointing. 5/10 Bethany Cox"
769,67,7,0,"Its not bad, it is just becoming very blank, what made GOT GOT is lost.
It's very sad they ran out of books and it seems without that guidance they are turning to classic hollywood style of filming.
Caracters have lost their identities, they are just a pale version of themselves and everything is filled up with predictable conversations seen in thousand hollywood movies.
Season 7 all over again.
GRRM why didn't you finish the books? Lol"
768,67,7,0,"We got a very tepid start for the last season of one of the greatest shows of the decade, and it seems this season will suffer from the same deficiencies of Season 7, namely, absolutely terrible pacing, mediocre writing and predictability. I think the magic of the earlier seasons are definitively gone at this point.All those problems stem from the fact that there is no longer any source material. Instead of condensing an already fantastic series of books, now the writing team is tasked with filling gaps and turning an outline into a coherent narrative. And thus, all the deficiencies (such as tropes, gaping plot holes, and predictability) of standard Hollywood screenwriting became apparent the in last couple of seasons.Many central characters such as Tyrion, the Hound, Daenerys and Jon Snow have progressively lost key aspects of their personality and become run-of-the-mill tropes. The terrible pacing simply exacerbates this issue as the show-runners attempt to go through a ""check list"" and juggle so many different arcs in a 45-50 min episode. The result is a complete lack of depth, character development, and very short scenes, and we the audience simply can't get as emotionally invested in the characters as before.But, we can expect some key revelations tying up the story and fantastic CGI dragons and battles, so this will definitely be entertaining just not on par with earlier seasons."
93,5,7,0,"The previous episode was awesome and so my expectations in this ""A Golden Crown"" were pretty high. As it turns out, it totally manages to hold up the pace of its predecessor and contains a couple of important things happening. I was extremely looking forward to see how things will be after Ned's and Jaime's fight and it already began in a superb way when Ned awoke with a furious Cersei and a King Robert who has finally calmed down after his uproar in ""The Wolf and the Lion"" standing in his room. The episode didn't get any worse after that, but I'd say it was already one of the best moments.The continuation of the storyline of Catelyn and Tyrion proved to be hilarious with once again, a marvelous monologue by Peter Dinklage and great performances by all other actors involved. The sword fighting in this episode was too really well-made and the fight scene in which we first meet Bronn was incredibly cool.Ned's discovery in this episode was great as well and really blew my mind because I'm completely unaware of the plot of this series. Sean Bean continually improves in his role and is amazing when he gets to be the regent while reminding the audience that he is clearly the most likable character on this show. It was also really nice to see Isaac Hempstead Wright doing something again and I think it's really interesting how Theon Greyjoy gets more and more important.Clearly the best part about ""A Golden Crown"" is the story part of Viserys, Daenerys, and the Dothrakis who return to the screen after their short absence in the previous episode. There are some major things happening with those characters and we really get to see how the characters progress - all of this is staged perfectly and has a really dark and captivating look to it since all of their scenes are set indoors. The final scene of this episode may just be the best Game of Thrones moment yet and I was so freaked out because of how fantastic this was. I'm completely intrigued in the plot (except for the one at the Night's Watch. Seriously, I didn't miss Jon Snow and all his colleagues at all in this and the last episode - I almost forgot that those characters existed when I was watching these two awesome episodes) and technically, it's extremely well-made. But I can't help myself but to think that Game of Thrones still has a tad more potential to it than it shows us at the moment with supernatural stuff and really big fight scenes still stashed away from the audiences. I'm hoping that the season finale will provide me with the scenes I expect and for now I just stay with loving all the amazing characters and visuals."
602,49,6,0,"Where do one start. Game of thrones has provided us with 4 great seasons of adaptations of the books. However, all good things must come to an end. The show writers have clearly showed their incompetence now. I think it's safe to say, that all the book readers and non-book readers agree that some changes are needed, to make a series of the books. However, as Benioff and Weiss has showed us, you can't do too many changes. And that's exactly what they did with season 5. Yes, the show is now ahead of the books in some story lines, but no, that's not an excuse.Benioff and Weiss have decided that shock value (although few of the events were even shocking) is more important than good writing. So lets start with Jon Snow being stabbed. In the breakdown of the episode they talk about how they didn't want a ''bad guy'' like Alliser Thorne to kill Jon. So they decide that Ollie should ''surprise'' us all and stab him. Although it has been clear for almost the entire season, that Ollie would do something stupid when Jon returned with the Free Folk. It was simply predictable and boring.The battle for Winterfell was almost a major disappointment. I don't mind that Stannis lost the battle. We still don't know the results in the books, but I assume he loses in the books as well, or this would have been an EXTREMELY stupid way to go for the show. However. Stannis is supposed to significantly outnumber the Bolton force, and he's perhaps the greatest general in Westeros. Take that, and combine it with the build up they've done for the entire season, and you'll get one hell of an ending to the season. Or not. Because what the f*ck, happened? In the show half of the army desert before the battle. OK, but that if he had such a large force to begin with, he shouldn't have been so outnumbered as he was. Not to mention how he just walked into a trap, and then not even preparing a strategy. They didn't even show the battle. So what was the point of the build up then? And then, at the end you have Brienne killing Stannis, with some stupid logic. I mean, you butchered the character of Brienne and Stannis in one episode. Do you really mean that Brienne was THAT stupid? ''Rightful king''. What!? Everyone. And I mean EVERYONE in Westeros knew Stannis was the rightful king by law. It doesn't mean they supported him, but they weren't stupid. Brienne obviously was.The Sand Snakes continue to be awkward and bad. ''You want a good girl but need a bad pussy''. Are you shooting a porn? Like seriously, WHAT THE F*CK!? How did anyone come up with lines like those? And yet again, you kill off a character who haven't died in the books (and probably won't do anytime soon either).Theon rescuing Sansa from Miranda, only to jump of the wall in what seems like a suicide. What a surprise! Now we're left with a useless cliffhanger.These are just some of the things I've found bad with the episode, I could have gone on for much more, but that wouldn't leave place for why I didn't rate the episode 1 star. For even though the episode were at times incredibly stupid, some parts were brilliant. Cerseis walk of shame, and the incident with Arya was both well done storyline-wise, and actually done in the show. Making an otherwise stupid episode at least watchable, and also earning it 6 stars fr"
765,66,3,0,"I have found this show to be enthralling, but this episode (even worse, actually: season finale, as I only found out after watching it) was like a slap in the face, and the disappointment only grows the more I think about it. As I was watching I couldn't help but get excited, but then quickly realised I just witnessed blatant abuse of my own and others' fascination and love for a great story.I haven't read the books (I hope those who have can take refuge in them), but I very much enjoyed the way an intricate world was meticulously built up and used as stage for incredible plots, twists, battles, and great character development (which was all the more satisfying as characters we'd been led to believe were 'main' got swatted like flies, and others stepped forward).The TV show did a great job of all this, but then at some point (perhaps when running out of book material) decided to (or could only manage to) pump this delicate foundation for cheap thrills and fan service, glossed over with spectacular Hollywood action scenes. Plot lines carefully laid over years have been torn up and clumsily tied together for the sake of some ""awesome scenes"", and nothing has been done protect the integrity of the GoT world or story. After this episode there is little left to excite anyone - who honestly cares about any of the characters anymore? All that's waiting for us is a clash of living vs dead - it's like we're all incredibly excited to see the next crappy zombie movie to come out.The show has plenty of momentum left for a chance to redeem itself, but it will take hard work to patch together something respectable from the rubble left by these last episodes."
303,21,7,0,"Pacing wise, this is similar to the first episode of season 3, but for me, it is a little bit better.We catch up with Jaime Lannister and Brienne of Tarth, and we also get the welcome return of Arya Stark with Gendry and Hot Pie, they were some of the most entertaining characters in the last series. Gwendoline Christie and Nikolaj Coster-Waldau have a great chemistry and it is a joy to watch as their characters trade insults and argue.
We get introduced some new characters, the introduction of Noah Taylor's Locke, is brief, but in our our first glimpse at the Brotherhood without Banners it proves a lot of fun. With Paul Kaye's Thoros of Myr, the writers have created a character that Kaye brings to vibrant life. There's something magnetic about Kaye's performance. But for me the introduction of Lady Olenna-the Queen of Thorns is the big one. Diana Rigg is a delight, I adore her.I have to say, I'm not loving the Bran storyline, it slows things down too much. not the fault of any of the actors, as they are all competent I also did not love the scene with Catelyn and Tulisa. Poor writing (I'm sure to give her character some sympathy) aside, it does not ring true, and was a mistake.The episodes ends on an appropriate cliffhanger that should keep viewers wanting to come back for more, but the pace needs to pick up a bit. don't get me wrong!! This is a perfectly solid episode, with some fine performances and moments, but it's never going to be classed among the best episodes of the show."
763,66,6,0,"The reason this shows was populor was because it gave a realistic feeling of fantasy world. I am very disappointed with Season 7, poor story writing, too much rush, predictable story, too many plot holes and lack of sensational music which all made it the best show so far. I am a big fan of GOT but season 7 was honestly very disappointing."
604,49,3,0,"OK, we agree that we all love unexpected twist and turns, and the unpredictable shows are always the best.We loved so many surprises in this show and that's part of what made GoT so good.I haven't read the books, but I've heard they want to stray away from them to keep it more interesting. No argue there.But this time, what we see in this episode is a meaningless death (I'm not spoiling anything, of course you expect someone to die in the last episode of a season, don't you?).There is simply no real reason to do that, clearly this is not how the story is meant to go on, and it makes so much of what has already happened basically pointless. It washes away a lot of what we've seen, and I won't be surprised if more people will do what I will: give up the series and start reading the books.I don't know whose idea this was (Martin's or the producers'), but IMO it is purely a run for sensational, and an attempt to attract publicity through shock.I believe that this episode was a total failure."
748,64,1,0,"It feels the amazing world built in the first 5 seasons has been handed over to a couple of teenage fans to shuffle around...We have had 2 decent episodes out of 5 so far, with 2 to go. This math simply does not add up...I used to be so excited and proud to recommend this series to anyone and everyone with a brain. Now I feel embarrassed to admit I still watch it myself. This has gone from an intricate and highly intelligent story into the most mundane and predictable nonsense. The fan theories floating around are more developed and thought out than the actual direction the plot of the show is taking...The p*ss poor writing, directing and editing of the last 2 seasons have affected the cast of great actors as well into performing forced dialogues and scenarios. The show has lost it's heart. Everything feels so flat, there are no more logical twists or schemes. Characters just show up from place A to place B and read their lines in the most monotone way possible then proceed to move from point B back to point A to repeat their forced dialogues. Motives make no sense anymore and every scenario is so predictable that fans essentially guess major plot points weeks ahead, and in very unfamiliar GoT fashion, the show runners seem to oblige the silliest of the theories. This episode felt like a combination of ""Star Trek: Next Generation"" cross ""Lost"".The problem lies in the fact that this series started out attracting intelligent viewers globally due to its complexity and multi-layered story line that resonated in reality and felt extremely grounded. It has now turned (Seasons 6 & 7) into your average run of the mill TV series riddled in plot armour and predictability and therefor appeals to teenagers and children and has essentially sold out it's core fan base. This in turn has us stuck in a predicament where we are too invested to turn our backs on the series, therefore we end up lying to ourselves that this series is still what it once was... It's not. It hurts me to say it as I've tried to lie to myself and get myself to take Seasons 6 and 7 seriously and ignore the shortcomings, but my brain simply will not allow it. Therefore I feel somewhat betrayed and my intelligence insulted week after week and this show has me feeling stupid for still watching it.Peter Baelish (the man who started the war of the 5 kings), has turned into a cartoon villain from Darkwing Duck, which therefore trickles down to every other major character being completely dumb-ed down as well. I will be watching the series until the end as I have committed 7 + years of my life to this world now, but I don't think I will continue to lie to myself to save my feelings any longer.... Season 6 had 2 great episodes, and season 7 has had 2 as well. That is 4 episodes out of the last 15 that have been GoT standards. Whereas Seasons 1 through 5 were near flawless in my book. The series died with Jon Snow as far as I'm concerned and I will gladly re-watch the first 5 seasons over and over again, and fill in the rest for myself I suppose...So f#*%@$g disappointing."
605,49,1,0,"Unlike so many prone to sing praises of GOT this season, I completely disagree. Many times during this season I questioned why I was bothering to watch this show. My sense was that it was mainly because of it's better past and hoping for some return to former glory or some kind of redemption for sucking away so much of my time and energy. The writing this season many times left me feeling that the writers really didn't want to do the show anymore. Story lines grew weak and characters grew flat. There were a few places that it lived up to expectations based on past success but for the most part this season and most of all this finale were sub par. I have not read the books. And while I didn't care for some of the directions that story lines took, all of that could have been overcome by better writing. Granted based on past success there was a lot to live up to, but this season the writers did a very poor job. If I decide to watch next season at all, it will be after it is over so I don't waste time wondering what will happen. Based on this season it would be constant disappointment."

But a lot of CGI.This Episode was so extremely disappointing, because it is the antithesis of it's own core essence. Instead of a gritty, grounded and deep Story about, loyalty, bravery and human nature, this Episode sold it's Soul for a shallow CGI fest, where everything is force bend to create fake tension and cool One-Liners. Everyone (except Tormund) is out of character and yoloing their way through this Episode. If Game of Thrones jumped the shark, this is the Episode it happened."
757,65,1,0,"Well, looking at the surprisingly high score and the drastically divided opinions towards this season, I would say that GoT has dropped to Transformers level. This applies to both the quality of the show and its fanbase.The high score owes partially to its brilliant past, but it doesn't mean that in any way it deserves the score it has right now.The writers are great at adapting the books, but they certainly suck at creating based on mere traces. Maybe they would do better if they were not briefed by George R. R. Martin, cuz at least they would not be dancing in fetters.R.I.P. GoT."

753,65,4,0,"***** Might contain slight spoilers ***** For me, this episode is one of the weakest in the entire series, with plenty of things wrong with it, but let's start with the good staff first.The visual and sound effects are good, directing is fine, acting is as good as it was in the first seasons. Some scenes are epic, especially the end of the episode.But everything else is straight awful. The dialog in the first seasons was much superior to what we see now. The drama between the characters, their motivations, cunning tricks and lies are either absent or terribly made. And the general plot writing is just horrible, not at all GOT level, more like Marvel movies with last minute saves and illogical events. The lack of the books shows vastly and the show writers are not able to write anything nearly as good as George R. R. Martin creates.Generally, the show has gone downhill after season four, with only a few good episodes in season six, and one in each of seasons five and seven."

She has a gorgeous smile) and Drogo (Jason Momoa) then there is the noble Ned Stark.... Oh Ned....For me this episode suffers from it's a complete lack of Tyrion and Arya. (Two of my favourite characters) but it's still gripping TV none the less.And of course once again.... What an ending. I seem to say that after every episode, buy this show just makes you need to watch the next episode."

770,67,5,0,"I'm not so sure anymore... I've been binge-ing the earlier seasons in anticipation of this episode, and whilst I was sure even while watching Season 7 that there was something drastically wrong with the pacing and writing of it, now more than ever the lack of quality is crystal clear.Having just finished episode 1 of season 8 (weren't all these episodes supposed to be an hour-and-a-half long?), I feel a little disheartened. Not much happens in this episode, and that's fine, I am all for holding the action back and ramping up the drama leading up to it... however it's the same issues as Season 7 - the writing feels unintentionally comic, at times. The moments we all expect to see, unfold on screen in the most obvious manner possible. It conveniently cuts between different sequences to keep all storylines moving forward (of course, that has always been a pattern, but it never felt this constructed before). The characters seem to be wrapping up a major Hollywood Fantasy Blockbuster rather than the Game of Thrones we have grown to love and adore.I felt no emotion, just a smile here or there, which can't be helped... these are people I've spent the last 10 years with, even if they are delivering corny lines with a straight, serious face, I can't help but admire where they have reached in this tremendous journey.They do leave you with an interesting cliffhanger, where, for a second, I genuinely got excited about the moments that would follow... and were they the 1.5-hour episodes I was expecting, it may even have delivered some strong punches. But alas, in true Hollywood-Netflix-binge style, the only moment which carried within in some fire and some potential to get the heart racing... the screen cuts to black following a dramatic eye-exchange between two characters we love, and the credits roll."
722,61,7,0,"Came to 'Game of Thrones' fairly late in the game and due to being so busy the binge-watching was gradual. Have found myself truly loving the show, very quickly becoming one of my favourites. It totally lives up to the hype and not only does it do the brilliant source material justice (a rarity in television) it is on its own merits one of the finest, most addictive and consistently compelling shows in recent years and quality-wise it puts a lot of films in recent years to shame.Up to this very early point of 'Game of Thrones' penultimate season, my initial impression of Season 7 has been decent and promising but not completely satisfying. It is the season that settled the least quickly in my mind and it is not hard to see some of the disappointment with fans. The season opener ""Dragonstone"" epitomised the above, while ""Stormborn"" makes improvements but there are signs of the promising but not entirely satisfying feel of the start of Season 7. Can see the high critical praise, but am somewhere in the high middle of the very divisive fan reaction.""Stormborn"", while not quite sending up a storm as much as ought, does improve upon ""Dragonstone"". Things continue to be introduced, set up and put into place while there is enough intrigue to the existing characters and stories. Compared to ""Dragonstone"", ""Stormborn"" is far more eventful, has more tension in the character relationships, progresses characters (especially Arya) and storylines better, most scenes here serve far more of a point and don't feel like overlong padding and there are no misplaced or jarring cameos. At the same time, ""Stormborn"" did feel on the rushed side. If the pace had slowed down, character motivations would have been clearer and the character writing much more consistent. Euron, who continues to be written poorly, especially is inconsistent and doesn't make sense, and Yara and Ellania fare little better. The intimate scene between Grey Worm and Missandrei was drawn out and unnecessary, the only scene that felt like filler, and some of the writing doesn't flow very naturally and is uncharacteristically corny. Luckily, there are some great scenes, conflicts and characterisation to balance out what didn't work. The Arya, Daenerys and Dragonstone scenes are beautifully done, as are the chemistry between Daenerys and Jon and Tyrion and Littlefinger being as ever awesome. Another highlight is the exciting, affecting and gorgeously filmed climactic action sequence.In terms of acting, ""Stormborn"" is solid. There aren't any tour-De-force performances or especially outstanding ones, but nobody is terrible either. Maisie Williams, Emilia Clarke, Aidan Gillen, Kit Harrington and Peter Dinklage come off strongest. That for Euron is the weak link, but much of it is down to how Euron is written which would be beneath any actor.Visually, it looks amazing, as one would expect for 'Game of Thrones'. The scenery is throughout spectacular, the sets are hugely atmospheric and beautiful on the eyes with a real meticulous eye for detail and the costumes suit the characters to a tee. The make-up is beautifully done. As well the cinematography and editing, which are cinematic quality as well.One cannot not mention the thematically, orchestrally and atmospherically multi-layered music scoring and the unforgettable main theme. Again, worthy of a high-budget fantasy/action/drama film.Enough layers, passion and sensitivity in the writing, even if they don't come consistently.Summing up, decent episode but as 'Game of Thrones' has done so many masterpiece part of me couldn't help feeling disappointed. 7/10 Bethany Cox"
719,61,5,0,"Somehow the show writers got the gist of the ending from GRRM, it lacks drama, substance and moreover it is not how Game of thrones used to be. Yes, we all loved(hated) GoT for its unexpected twists, but from the last season the show runs on familiar grounds giving no room for twists or drama.I specifically emphasize on drama part because nobody talks in GoT from season 6, they are just filling up the silence with few sentences, it clearly shows when the wittiest character of the show who has been known for several epic speeches speaks hardly five lines in two episodes. They are clearly rushing to the end, tying up the knots. If they don't have enough material, they should have waited. I think they are ruining what Game of Thrones accomplished in first five seasons."
364,26,2,0,"First season they did a great job keeping the tension, drama, the stakes, everything tight and moving. Second season they did a damn good job. WHAT THE HELL HAS HAPPENED? Instead of dramatic arcs, episodes this season as a series of disjointed vignettes that they donʻt even try to weave a dramatic thread between. Instead they spend more time adding unnecessary detail to the extreme BDSM treatment of Theon Greyjoy. I love Iwan Rheon as an actor, but one or two quick scenes are enough to tell us about how Theon will evolve...this is gratuitous and the time would be better spent on laying out the over all narrative. If it werenʻt for the strong source material (thank you George RR Martin), this would be an unwatchable mess of disconnected plot points, under-motivated actions, and, as I pointed out, sex/violence that isnʻt being used to drive the narrative forward. The weak directing was most clearly demonstrated when the Yukai arrives to negotiate - what the hell was the purpose of the long arrival scene? To burn some of the budget and add minutes to fill out a short and empty episode? Hire some writers folks! Hire a new director! This is one of the most epic stories written and you gotta do better than your doing."

658,55,7,0,"Too many weak moments in this episode for it to be a spectacular episode. enough good moments for it to be a good episode. the weak moments were the end scene where its now become so predictable and there's no real character development involving Dany, there's also no in depth political issues regarding Dany the most in depth they go is Meereen with Tyrion, they need to show Dany struggling for power her having to endure more personal conflict, more infighting then the end scene where she conquers a city wont seem so boring and draining. Arya becomes a ""Stark"" again which is excellent. they've made her re galvanize hope again the bit where she gets needle back is excellent. they've somewhat copied they done with Sansa where they made her character suffer and they then seek the help of others to shy away from being who they really are then they figure out who they are again. the difference is they made Arya's route a lot more subtle and a lot more empathizing for me. they've made Jaime regress, he's back to the illogical,irrational over confident character, the one who people hated, hes resorting to violence firs where as before he was a lot calmer and more logical when planning. Tommen is looking really weak as a character, he seems very conflicted with himself with his beliefs and you almost get the feeling that the writers don't actually have a proper story for him and they are just throwing him in there with the high sparrow vs Lannisters and Tyrells battle. loved the opening scenes with Sam and Gilly you finally learn more about who Sam is, you see the resentment that's there between him and his father and you can see him becoming stronger as a character each season. him taking the sword and leaving his father's castle just shows now he has really strengthened as a character. overall good not spectacular."

This is not going to be a popular opinion, but for me ""No One"" was the first big disappointment of 'Game of Thrones'. Saying this because there are some controversial previous episodes and quite a few fans didn't like Season 5 in general. To me, the previous episodes ranged from good to special. Wouldn't say from personal opinion that ""No One"" is a terrible episode, but it is not a representation of what made me a fan of the show and do agree with many of the criticisms. Will start off with the good things. Visually, ""No One"" looks amazing, as one would expect for 'Game of Thrones'. The scenery is throughout spectacular, the sets are hugely atmospheric and beautiful on the eyes with a real meticulous eye for detail and the costumes suit the characters to a tee.

Again, worthy of a high-budget fantasy/action/drama film. Have no qualms with the acting, which all round is spot on with no exceptions regardless of the character writing and such. Wonderful to see Peter Dinklage again and Nikolaj Coster-Waldau does give some of his best acting here. A few of the story and script elements are done well. Tyrion's scene with Missandrei and Grey Worm is a highlight, while of the storylines the King's Landing (Cersei is awesome here!) and the Brotherhood Without Banners re-introduction come off best. Love Bronn, a great job was done with Jaime and did enjoy him with Brienne. A few nice lines.However, there are also major drawbacks. Do have to agree that Arya's storyline brings down ""No One"" significantly. Anti-climactic, contrived and implausible with an out of character Arya (even when taking into account the defence the story has gotten), it was a mess. Was mixed on the Riverrun scenes. Love Jaime and there are some gritty, intense and emotional parts. The storyline just felt too rushed and resolved too easily. And sorry, Blackfish deserved much better treatment than he got here. For me, too much of ""No One"" felt on the rushed side and it all felt too tidy and pat. Other episodes do a far better job progressing the characters and subplots (Jaime comes closest here), some people may argue that this is one of those setting up and putting things into place episodes, but ""The Broken Man"" did that much better while still moving things forward. And please make Tommen and Edmure more interesting, there is not enough to them yet to pass as ""love to hate"" etc. characters yet.Overall, a disappointment while still being watchable. 5/10 Bethany Cox"
674,57,5,0,"While many reviews I see on IMDb talk about the show being inconsistent (""I liked this episode much more than the last 4! Show was getting boring"") I generally love almost every episode. I enjoy slower scenes as long as they further character arcs and their plots against each other, which they almost always do. This is one of the 3 or 4 episodes I would rate below an 8/10. And since this is the very worst episode of the series I think a 5 is justified. ""No One"" focuses heavily on the culmination of Arya's Braavos adventure, the worst plot line of the entire series besides the horribly implemented Sand Snake garbage. I enjoy the city and culture of Braavos, but 80% of the time we have been stuck in the Faceless god's shoddy cathedral, and for these last two seasons it has been apparent that none of these events are going to have any impact on the metaplot. None of these characters are going to come with Arya back to Westeros, unlike with Danyeris where at times the plot seems completely separate from Starks/Kings Landing/The North, at least you know with Dany she is going to cross and bring many of her plot threads with her. These two seasons of Arya have basically just been about building her character up into a more ruthless killer, but all you have to do is go back to season 4 and see that she is quite a capable killer already on the road with the Hound. Her character doesn't develop emotionally, she resolutely is still the same vengeance driven victim she was from season 2 on. So basically I am saying Arya's two seasons in Braavos are filler, and this poorly directed, convenience driven action finale does nothing to redeem the arc.Edmure Tully has been characterized as a incompetent weakling but no precedent has been made that his character would willingly betray his families honor and sacrifice his Uncles life for the life of a baby that he has never seen and was conceived though an enemy trap. The siege on Riverrun is never shown, we get one shot of the Blackfish unsheathing his sword in a stairwell, and he is killed off screen. Arya's final duel with the Nameless Girl occurs, OFFSCREEN! We have to suffer through another ""Tyrion doesn't know how to relate to his former- slave advisors!"" filler scene. One was enough. The fact that we haven't seen Tyrion in 2 episodes, and then this one has two quick scenes (one being filler) before the city is being sieged just emphasizes how little material they had for Tyrion this season.I like Tyrions line about being the ""Most famous Dwarf in the World,"" I like that Jaime gets to embrace his dark side which we haven't seen since season 2. I also enjoyed Pof and Bronn's reunion. The scenes of Cersei being further diminished are adequate. And also there has been a pattern set for the 8th episode being monumental (Hard Home, Viper v Mt), this one was a huge letdown."

At Renly's camp we are introduced to new characters ""the Maid of Tarth"", Brienne (Gwendoline Christie) and Margaery Tyrell (Natalie Dormer)There is no Danaerys or Stannis in this episode. The centerpiece of this episode, the thing that gives it its title, is Theon's story takes up a lot of time in this episode.

673,57,3,0,"I am only going to mention the Arya plot line, as I agree with the posters on the first page of this reviews section - Karl, Nathan, Delta, etc, that it was very poor.I have only seen the TV series, not read the books but I loved it. The grimness, unpredictability, characters dying, bad guys winning etc, made it hugely different to most other things on TV. I was begging the Red Viper not to do something flashy but kill the Mountain ""Pleeeasee, shut up, stab him some more"" We know how that ended up.Apart from the magic, the world is grimly realistic. Did you note how in this episode, as Varys and Tyrion were saying touching goodbyes, there were several beggars around, and Varys wafted past them as though they didn't exist...and he's one of the most sensitive and concerned people in the series. That's GoT world folks.On to the Arya stuff. We've all be led to believe that she is going to become some sort of pint-size super soldier - with the twin-track sword-training of Silvio Forel and her later assassin Masters in the House of B/W.So once the Waif (plus possibly others) is on her trail she's got to have a super-cunning plan.We've all seen a lot of films where the hero beats enemies by sheer wit and cunning. That's what we wanted. Like many of you, when she was arrogantly strutting around, flashing cash (and not wearing Needle - eh?) it seemed like a big setup. Or as some theories said Jaquen impersonating Arya. So walking into an ambush where a crone turns into the Waifinator and getting gut-stabbed...is that a plan?No,in Medieval times its death. Pre-antibiotics peritonitis is fatal. I read somewhere that 25% of medieval warfare casualties died of this agonisingly after the battle and there was no cure. A Viking re- enactor friend of mine said ""Onion Soup"" when I asked him about this. ""Eh?"" I said. He explained that if someone had a gut wound, he would be given onion soup and then they would smell his wound - if it smelled of onions, he would be given a priest, if it did not they would sew him up and hope he would survive.It's totally unbelievable that Arya could survive multiple stabbings and falling into disease-ridden water, then do a full Braavos Parkour.Let's look at that E7 sequence again:Arya goes around approaching the Westeros sailors. She has needle. When the crone approaches, Arya isn't fooled and draws her sword and there is a fight and both the waif and Arya are cut but not seriously, then she dives off the bridge and escapes. That's more believable and sets up that A is not the Waif's victim any more.I can think of various other ways of Arya beating the waif, for example if she was injured when the Waif kills Lady Crane, but had Needle, then pretends to be in a drugged sleep and just stabs her though the heart then that would reveal that she has become a deadly assassin. Or we see the mammoth fight which we were cheated out of. While they wasted time with an irrelevant jokes scene. Quite frankly someone with a small dagger v basket hilted rapier is probably not ever going to win.....That's why I found it all so stupid, and insulting to my intelligence.The plotting of this was basically pants.

Major events include the confrontation between the fraternal kings Renly and Stannis, Peter Baelish showing up at Renly's camps to persuade both him and Catelyn Stark, Daenerys and her Khalasar finding an accommodation at last, Arya doing so as well, however, in a less pleasant way, Robb Stark and his army again defeating the Lannister ones, and King Joffrey demonstrating malice that goes way beyond normality.And let's start with talking about that scene in particular. It involves sexual humiliation and violence that left me awestruck while also questioning its necessity. A scene like that never occurred in the original novels and I believe the series would've also been better off without it. Not only because it's utterly unappealing to watch, but also because I just don't buy Joffrey being that evil. It's not normal and we've already had his cruelty depicted numerous times before, so why include it? If I'd like to see a pornographic actress (she is one, look it up) have her derrière beaten with a belt, there are other movies to watch. Aside from that, Jack Gleeson once again impressed me with his acting qualities.Later on, there's another very sexually explicit moment in ""Garden of Bones"". It's a disturbing, puzzling, and jaw-dropping cliffhanger as unexpected as it gets. And while this one was in the source material as well, I still don't like it. At first I reckoned this sentiment to be utter confusion about what just happened and so I could prevent writing an overhastily critical review, I decided to watch episode five right afterwards. Yet, it turns out that I still don't like it and what happened in the next episode was actually the most disappointing moment of the whole series yet – specifics on that in my review for ""The Ghost of Harrenhal"". I'm aware that quite a lot of people seemed to love that scene, but I've watched it twice and my personal conclusion is that it's a form of fantasy Game of Thrones didn't need at all. I didn't have any problems with White Walkers or dragons, but what happened here took me out of the story completely and just didn't feel right.Thankfully, the other story parts of this episode were really good and almost made me forget about the aforementioned two. Best of all, the introduction of Qarth: a walled oasis in the middle of the desert, entitled ""the greatest city that ever was or will be"". The opening of its gates was one of the Game of Thrones' most rememberable moments and revealed a masterpiece of its set designers. The curious folk we're making acquaintance with there is different from everything else in the series, and a sub-plot that hopefully receives its deserved attention in the next couple of episodes. The second new location, Harrenhal, is a far uglier place that serves the sole purpose of capturing, torturing and eventually killing Lannister prisoners. A process that could've been made more entertaining to watch, but I'll stop complaining for once and will say that I enjoyed it a lot. Maisie Williams gives a fantastic turn while a surprise guest voluntarily visits this location.As always, there's also Peter Dinklage, the imp responsible for keeping up HBO's ratings, who amazes with his enormous acting qualities. Receiving far less praise as she should is Natalie Dormer as Margaery Tyrell, making her character wonderfully exciting to watch while having a conversation with Aidan Gillen's Peter Baelish – a stand-out moment in the episode's screenplay.That makes for an episode that disappointed me at times, but was also rememberable and enthralling on other occasions. Minor flaws just can't curb my amazement for this series."

357,25,7,0,"This episode is heavy on the interpersonal exchanges, scheming and plotting that ""Game of Thrones"" does so well, this time tinged with even more of an air of desperation and terror, not to mention a heavy dose of psychotic sadism."
206,13,3,0,"The first season of Game of Thrones was an incredible, wonderfully crafted fantasy adventure that made us addicted to the series. But this season the air is very different. The good story is sacrificed to the shock effect. This episode we had to watch ten minutes of torture. Not gory, but still, was it necessary? Game of Thrones got us with its witty dialogue and well drawn characters and its story, not with this kind of tricks. Creating emotions with torture and sadism belongs to cheaper productions who can't create emotional reactions through its story. I don't want to be left feeling dark and disgusted after each episode, I want to be left feeling the satisfaction of watching a great adventure crafted with art, just as I felt after the season 1 episodes."

667,56,7,0,"It's because of the quality standards of this kind of episodes, ""Game of Thrones"" deserves to be criticized when somehow it deviates itself to a Hollywoodesque pretension of becoming a money apparatus for the audiences. Because it indeed damages its quality when this nonsense gets stuck in the heads of the economic maestros. Not only is unnecessary but also detrimental.This season has been generally like that with its ups and downs being the best of it plainly average because it gets banal when compared with other existent series made to be watched and thrown in the recycle bin.But this episode stroke me with a exhalation of hope. Truly... (or is it just me hungering for old GOT's primordial quality?) It proved me that the artistic sense of representation, an excellent script, the great dramatizations of great actors leaded by great directors orchestrating great ""musicians"" surpasses by far the hysteric need of special effects or everything having to be ""BIG"". Of course special effects are welcome, but they shouldn't be at the top of the pyramid of priorities. They are extras.Anyway, trash with that big. Big were the majestic dramatizations of Liam Cunningham (Ser Davos), Clive Russell (Brynden 'Blackfish' Tully), Diana Rigg (Olenna Tyrell) and most specially, the incredible Bella Ramsey (Lyanna Mormont). With honourable mentions to Natalie Dormer (Margaery Tyrell), Rory McCann, Ian McShane (Brother Ray) and Tim McInnerny (Robett Glover).And also BIG were the photography, the wardrobe, the landscapes, the characters developments, this episode."

However when they are having dinner, his father Randyll discovers that Gilly is a Wildling and insults the couple. Tommen meets the High Sparrow that allows him to visit Margaery and she confesses that she repented her sins. Out of the blue, Jaime commands the Tyrell army through King's Landing to release Margaery and Loras, but he is surprised by the revelation of an alliance of the Faith and the Crown. In Braavos, Arya meets Lady Crane and they have a conversation about acting. Then Arya saves the actress from poisoning. However Waif witnesses her behavior and reports to Jaqen that asks her to kill Arya. Meanwhile Arya retrieves the Needle from the hidden place on the rocks and brings it to her room. Daenerys and Daario have a conversation about the number of ships she needs to cross the Narrow Sea with her army. Then she leaves him and returns riding Drogon. ""Blood of My Blood"" is the sixth episode where Arya finally has an attitude about Jaqen orders. The segment with Bran with his visions is annoying. Sam and Gilly are offended and now they will live outside Horn Hill. The alliance between The Crown and the Faith by the silly Tommen will be certainly destroyed by Jaime. The speech of Daenerys riding Drogon is the best moment of this show. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Blood of My Blood"""
660,55,1,0,"Read the books and watched the show, this was the first episode i would have rather not watched. I cringed for most of it, it was boring with cliché lines ""did they hurt you etc"" . The show for the first time looked like i was watching a normal show and not a high budget movie. Brans story line was good, but lasted very few minutes while we had loads of Sam's family, Tomman being a coward and pointless talking. And they showed the Tyrell army in the trailer only to have them withdraw cause tommon joined the faith in the show, why? its like they want viewers to hate the show. At this point they might as well copy and paste Daenerys' speeches to save money, it's the same and seems like they can't do without a ""i will take back what is mine"" from her at least every other episode. considering the claims that this season cost $10million per episode, this was disappointing."
319,22,7,0,"Ouch. Did you find yourself clutching your wrist at the end of this week like we did? Game Of Thrones has never exactly been a slouch in delivering shock endings, but this week will take some beating."
366,26,6,0,"Jon and Ygritte are the highlight of the episode, keep your eyes on them! There's also a piece of history that is revealed from their dialog that adds weight to their mission. I even liked the scene between Robb and Jeyne. The love scenes in this season as a whole are done particularly well actually. This is probably to compensate for dulling our senses with all the gratuitous yet equally unnecessary sex/extreme violence scenes that are all over the place in this show. Unfortunately these are present in this episode as well, but at least they don't go the full way (which I was afraid they would at one point, unsurprisingly involving Theon).The evolution of Brienne and Jaime are a delight to watch... at least they were in the beginning, but by the end of it I felt some writers forgot about these characters entirely and had to come up with lines for them just before the actors went on cameras. There is also a near escape sequence that was done particularly poorly, bearing witness to the show's budget constraints and human retardation. 'How could a man with only 1 hand climb that?' - I found myself asking. 'Damn with the limitations of human nature and physics!' - said every Hollywood director that ever lived, ever!!Bronn's character - damn, that guy likes reminding us that he's a good actor. The banter between him and Tyrion is fun, as usual, while the little man has some tough decisions ahead of him, judging from what they set up for him this far. Let's hope those end up being executed well.Sansa is still hanging around with Margaery; I guess some things never change. Bran, Hodor, the Reed brothers and that wild-ling lady (I always forget her name) are still heading North, but suffice to say is they're probably not going to meet any familiar faces anytime soon. Arya is still mad on the Brotherhood. Melisandre is still weird as... the night sky would be with two moons? No complaints there. Sam and his new friend with the baby are completely absent in this episode bo-hoo.Daenarys is fierce as ever and those dragon, ho-boy. They know how to portray their dragons in this show! She's kind of reached a halt, at this grand-city called Yunkai, that was build on the back of many, many slaves and well... she's a bit unhappy about that. I'm curious to see just how much she gets held back by this new challenge :DSadly there was no scene featuring Cersei, either. So where do we get our dose of barely contained rage, by a thin shell of cynicism you wonder? Look no further than Tywin's scene with Joffrey. It's always nice to see two badass blondes - each in their own way - duke it out for the best.So, what is my final take on this episode: sub-par. I was left at the end with a taste of bitter bile in my mouth and that wasn't due to the coffee I had while watching it. You see, even though I praised individual scenes, the sum of its parts is not greater than the whole, surprisingly. The motivation behind the characters seem a bit shallow, probably because they are so many at this point and so far apart from each other... It's like all the major characters' strengths rely on one- another, but as soon as they have an individual scene to perform, they act bewildered. And you know which are the main characters of the show I'm talking about: they are all the surviving ones, from the 1st season with few additions. Also, it's like they are not given enough care from the directors and the producers involved, like their personal journey and evolution does not matter, unless it involves another sex/extreme violence scene. Well, I CARE about these characters' evolution arcs and I WANT to see them being well-portrayed damit!The set-pieces are great - GoT crew! - and the amount of detail are charming to the eye, but... look, if this show wasn't sourcing Martin's masterpiece material, I would not be watching this. The 1st season was great and I can find absolutely no criticism: it was raw and powerful. With the 2nd and 3rd season, I feel like I am forced to watch the limitations of the productions's team, botching big action scenes and generally showcasing an unfocused view of their product. If you want to sell this to me AGAIN then you will have to figure out a direction for the story and not just do stuff 'because George Martin said so'. Books don't work the same as stories meant for the screens. Where's your sense of independence that season 1 thrived on and drove the show to success?*Sigh* I miss the good old days... does that make me old?"

717,60,7,0,"I love Game of Thrones, I've been watching the Series ever since Season1 and long before it has been hyped all over the globe. I really looked forward to Season 7 and I was a bit surprised when I read that they did cut the amount of Episodes for the last two Seasons.Thats why I expected the Episodes to be paced a bit faster in order to fit in all the missing pieces. However, Episode 1 was far from fast-paced and it did not really develop the plot any further to be honest. It starts really promising, with a scene that got me feel chills in my spine and than it somehow falls into a list of dialogue sequences in most plot-areas, the dialogue content was overall not really important. We even see a (rather long) cameo from a real-life musician that seemed extremely odd and immersion- breaking. The Episode started to generate a bit of tension in the last few minutes, but overall it was pretty boring and I hate to say that...I can't really give this one more than a 7 and that's only because of the good start of the Episode. I really hope that the future Episodes will add more tension to the plot and we actually see some things happening. There aren't a lot of Episodes left to tell the tale.Regards, David."
249,17,7,0,"""The Prince of Winterfell"" is a more character-focused episode than any that came before it this season, providing the calm before the storm. Plot in A Paragraph: Arya calls in her final debt with Jaqen in a way that he is not amused with. Robb finds out that Theon is not the only person to go behind his back. At Winterfell, Theon receives a visitor. Tyrion and Varys bond, Danaerys ignores Ser Jorah's advice. Stannis and Davos approach their destination. I really liked Gemma Whelan's performance as Yara and Alfie Allen performs strongly, as he has throughout this second season as Theon.I didn't think Peter Dinklage could improve on his Emmy winning performance of the first season but his amazing turn this season has been ridiculously good, he has several excellent scenes that show his talent as an actor. He shares a brilliantly emotional scene with Shae (Sibel Kekilli) and his scene with Varys (Conleth Hill) is one of my favourites of the season. Hill shines whenever he is in a scene with Dinlklage.Lena Headey's Cersei actually seems to rise to the occasion of being in a scene with him in this episode. Normally he blows her off the screen, I've not disliked her as much as I did in this episode since the beginning of season one. Charles Dance has been excellent as Tywin Lannister, and his scenes with Maisie Williams were always good, but perhaps too much of a good thing as I will miss them now Tywin has left Harrenhal. Their scenes have been some of my favourites of this season. On the negative side the Robb and Talisa story features two very good looking people doing their best with material that is cliché through and through. Oona Chaplin has a nice bum though, and I hope we get to see more of it. Lol Emilia Clarke and Michelle Fairely are again weak links acting wise too. Back to the good. I really liked the interplay between Brienne and Jaime as the Maid of Tarth leads her prisoner to a boat. Now bring on episode 9 and the battle of blackwater. What promises to be the biggest of the season."
713,60,7,0,"After more than one year waiting for ""Game of Thrones"" (the last episode was on 26 Jun 2016) and the beginning of a seven-episode season, the slow-paced ""Dragonstone"" is deceptive. With the exception of Arya's revenge and Samwell's discovery of the ""dragonstones"", the rest of the episode is boring and practically pointless going nowhere.

157,10,7,0,"The second season's first episode takes us right back to George R. R. Martin's fantastic creation Westeros and as soon as the HBO logo has left the screen and the legendary opening credits start, it feels as if we have never left this amazing fantasy world. In the very first scene, underage asshole king Joffrey reminds us why we all hate him so much while also delivering an immensely entertaining scene that directly merges into another one involving the only two characters that are even more entertaining than Joffrey: his mother and his uncle, Cersei and Tyrion Lannister. The two have a heated debate during the Small Council that has Tyrion delivering this episode's most rememberable one-liner, ""It must be hard for you to be the disappointing child."" This marks as the first real confrontation between those two and it is awesome. The fierce chemistry between the mutually abhorring brother and sister is magnificent and shows the enormous acting qualities of Peter Dinklage and Lena Headey. Because of this scene, the episode has already had its top point in the first ten minutes, but that isn't really bothering since the simple comeback of all those great characters that we learned to love or hate (sometimes both) in the first season is absolutely great. Some scenes admittedly lack the tension and fantastic screen writing that the one with Cersei and Tyrion had, yet the further evolving of the different characters is enough to keep anyone who liked Game of Thrones in its primal season delighted. Additional intensity comes from a new setting that involves Stannis Baratheon, rightful claimant for the Iron Throne, and television's hottest redhead since Christina Hendricks in Mad Men. It's hard to grasp what is exactly going on in – where are those scenes set, for Christ's sake? -, but future episodes will surely give more insight into Stannis, Melisandre (a.k.a. ""Hot Redhead""), and the other characters involved. The introduction to this location was definitely very well-done, however, I remember to have been way more swept away by how they presented us all the settings in season one.All the other basic locations of the series return as well, with the Night Watch part going into a whole new direction that seems utterly appealing to me. The scenes at the Stark camp are quite good, especially the argument between Robb Stark and his captive Jaime Lannister; while the five minutes in which we travel across the Narrow Sea to find neo-dragon mother Daenerys and her extremely exhausted 'khalasar' are a bit unfulfilling. It's sad that not even dragons can help those scenes get any more interesting, they still are the weakest fraction of the series, like we were used to it previously.All in all, we shouldn't forget that this is one of the visually best TV series of all time and the whole look ranging from cinematography and editing to make-up, costumes, and set design is absolutely grand. And though creators David Benioff and Dan Weiss start to deviate from the novels more remarkably at this point, it's still a fantastic adaption. I believe my high rating for this episode is warrantable since the weaker parts really don't carry weight that much and it's just tremendously entertaining to watch."

Emilia Clarke, Lena Headey Michelle Fairley and Iain Glenn I'm talking to you Sophie Turner is good as Sansa, and she shares a good scene with The Hound.

Also great was the scenes with Varys and Tyrion - this could have been played out with sympathy or regrets or feeling sorry but was very well shown by the main two leads.

167,10,7,0,"In the last episode of the first season, we saw the aftermath of Ned Stark's execution, we saw Jon accompany Lord Commander Mormont on a mission beyond the Wall and, most of all, we saw the birth of dragons.Plot In A Paragraph: As Robb Stark (Richard Madden) and his northern army continue the war against the Lannisters, Tyrion (Peter Dinklage) arrives in King's Landing to counsel Joffrey (Jack Gleeson) and control the young king. Stannis Baratheon plots an invasion to claim his late brother's throne, whilst Daenerys (Emilia Clarke), her three young dragons and khalasar trek through the Red Waste in search of allies, or water.The opening of the episode starts strongly but at times scenes feel slightly rushed. the sparkling presence of Tyrion Lannister, played by Peter Dinklage (Who deservedly won an Emmy for his work in the first season) is a breath of fresh air whenever he's in a scene, easily dancing around Joffrey's and Cersi'z jibes. I particular liked the scene where he offers his condolences to, and is assessing (you can see it in his eyes) how Sansa Stark (Sophie Turner) has found a way to survive, by saying the words they expect. And when he discusses getting Jamie back form the Stark's ""you had three Starks to trade. You chopped ones head off, you let another escape.... Father would be disappointed."" Another scene I liked, was one with Robb, Jaime a very large direwolf in Grey Wind. Nikolaj Coaster-Waldauand Richard Madden both do a fine job.My big complaint with this episode would be the absence of Arya (played Maisie Williams, who I was a big fan of last season) except for the very last shot of the episode. All in all, this episode has some of the same problems that the show had in its premiere last year: a lot of ground to cover, and not enough time.

The story line is very obviously rushed and you can tell that D&D has put little thought into writing a script that could match the levels of the earlier seasons, instead they opted for a more cinematic approach with impressive visuals."
821,71,4,0,"Great acting, great production, and mind blowing CGI cannot make up for poor writing.""It's easy to do things that are shocking or unexpected, but they have to grow out of characters. They have to grow out of situations. Otherwise, it's just being shocking for being shocking."" -GRRM"
820,70,1,0,"D&D ruined the greatest show of all time, they had plenty of time to do better.
i do hope HBO won't hire them for the upcoming projects, if every project end like this i don't see how we can trust anything this channel offer.
as first step i canceled my subscription."
819,70,1,0,Such pathetic writing ruined the whole show i apologize to everyone whom i recommend this show
34,1,7,0,"In the opener for this show, we had some major things happening in the plot, and now we see how the characters live with that. Just as in the George R. R. Martin novels, we see the story told from different points of view and just as in the opening episode, we learn that this show is more focused on introducing us to all the different characters rather than showing us immense fights or special effects like The Lord of the Rings movies. This is something that I highly appreciate and that I loved in ""Winter Is Coming"", but this episode was still a fairly big disappointment to me. I'll tell you why:The first episode of GoT was perfect in every imaginable way. The visuals were immensely stunning, the screenplay was a hundred per cent Emmy-worthy and the actors were really talented. This doesn't also disappear with this episode, but it's a huge surprise that David Benioff and D. B. Weiss weren't able to recreate the unique and fantastic vibe that the screenplay of ""Winter is Coming"" had with this follow-up. Some scenes are unnecessary (never a good sign for shows like this), they included annoying and idiotic soliloquies at times, and they dialogs aren't so good as they were in the former episode. I wasn't bored at all by this episode because I was already so into all the characters (I watched the opening episode 3 times on 3 days), but it focused too much on stupid stuff. All the stuff with Arya, Sansa, the butcher's boy and this gay prince whose name I always forget was complete nonsense and I can't see how this is necessary to the plot. The show seemed like a soap opera to me at that point. Some other plot parts were really good though, a great example is the one with Daenerys (put more Viserys in the next episode, he is a great character!) who's currently trying to make the best out of her lousy situation.Concluding, I enjoyed this episode a lot despite some things that bugged me. It's clearly inferior to ""Winter is Coming"", but it still has a magnificent visual look (gotta add that: the Blu-Ray quality is just one of the best I've ever seen!) and the actors really make the best out of it! The outstanding cast member in this episode was Lena Headey who was a fantastic minor villain."
825,71,3,0,7 seasons of character development and story telling for no reason. I really wish season 8 never happen.
818,70,1,0,"I think it says a lot that many viewers have never written a review before but have suddenly felt compelled to do so now. I'm in that same boat (kind of like being on one of Dany's boats, helplessly watching something that was incredible sink before our very eyes). I won't even get into the various plot holes, plot armor, or questionable/unexplained/avoided directions in writing. They have been thoroughly pointed out already. The whole argument of saying those who are disappointed only because the ending is not what they expected, is nonsense. Many including myself, would probably have preferred an ending they didn't expect as long as it made sense in the whole scheme of things. When a majority of characters begin to seemingly act out of character that they have been built up to be for years, fans will obviously have an issue with this. Also to those suggesting that anyone with such sudden criticism must not be a true fan is a complete cop out. We are venting our dissatisfaction with the product of what the series has become because of our heavy emotional investment in it. We have grown to love the characters, how they have evolved and just wanted their arcs to be completed in a logical manner. So yea, the just stop watching if you don't like it argument isn't that simple. To me, this season has the feel of a show that had to replace all it's major characters last minute and thus never feels the same. The faces haven't changed though, and this is in no way a knock on the actors themselves. I have great respect for their amazing portrayals over the years. I have never read the books but often enjoyed reading much of the book lore to get a better understanding of things. Have also read many fan theories/predictions as a fun way to compare them to my own. Just as I have never written a review, I have never read a single show review of the series prior to this season. I never felt the need to as I didn't care what others thought, I always loved it for what it WAS. With all the hype, buildup, and extended wait, what they have presented us with honestly feels like a slap in the face and it questions our intelligence. Feels like we have been scammed or cheated. After reading other's reviews, it oddly gave me a small sense of relief in knowing I'm not alone in my utter, heartbreaking disappointment. I guess that is the most I could possibly expect now in regard to the bittersweet ending I never saw coming. Shame."
816,70,1,0,"This garbage could not be further from the GoT that GRRM created.
Congratulations D&D for destroying one of the best shows ever! Please tell me that you spend so much money in season 8, because you filmed two versions: the joke version (the one we are watching now), and the real version written by grownups with common sense.
I stopped having any expectations since season 7, and yet you continue to amaze me with your stupidity. I can write for hours about plot holes, plot armors, idiotic dialogues, lack of congruence to character arcs or developments, Hollywood moments. Other reviews have covered these problems more fluently than I could, especially now that I could not care less.
GoT was my favorite show. I can't wait for it to be over, and for D&D to never work in TV again."
772,67,7,0,"This was a rather slow episode, more of a build up to the upcoming war. With so few episodes left, I feel they wasted a lot of time on nothing... just my opinion, no haters needed."
815,70,3,0,I don't want to rant or complain about this episode or series. I just wanted a good end to a great show. It's honestly heartbreaking to see this show end with such mediocrity.
814,70,2,0,"No continuity, no logic, rushed writing...Has the CGI budged grew so much the show had to fire people woring on continuity? King's Landing suddently moved to a flat dessert away from sea, hills and trees! Armies that were shown completly decimated last episode are half back up! I guess for shock value and visuals, they had to die but now we need them so that's ok I guess. There's no logic behind the scenes, giant scorpions have 100% accuracy, characters are blind and writers and stupid and not in control of their own material.Or they simply do not care any more because they've been paid already and they are already moved on to ruin Star Wars futher.7 seasons, 8 years of build up in the most intricate and interesting series ever shown on TV and THIS is what we are getting?
Who approved this?
Why?"
813,70,2,0,"""Dany forgot about the iron fleet.""Guess what D&D, no one remembers how you started - everyone will remember how it ended. You ruined Game of Thrones."
812,70,4,0,"I hoped it would never happen to the show, but it did. This show had been so superior in writing for the longest time and now it's just cutting corners for the sake of setting up some cool shots or dramatic takes, and it's an extreme disservice to not only the loyal fans but GRRM himself. I've tried to excuse it for the last couple of episodes, but this is not the Game of Thrones that I've loved for the longest time. I thought Game of Thrones was better than choosing shock-factor over actual storytelling, but I was wrong. I truly hope others can enjoy the new direction the show is taking, and if you do, then you are extremely lucky and I hope it lives up to your expectations. Sadly, however, I am not one of them. I'm sorry this is how it is ending, GRRM, because I don't think this is what you'd have wanted."
811,70,3,0,"Logic is completely out the window. All the character development over the last decade is utterly and completely gone. I loved this show and now unfortunately I could care less. Will I finish the story out, yes but the interest has dropped massively this season. It's hot garbage at this point, which is so disappointing. The only one who deserves the throne is Ghost."
810,70,2,0,"Because I literally heard one of the writers that ""Dany forgot about Euron's fleet""You suck so much D&D"
809,70,2,0,"I mean, seriously?D&D have made it impossible for me to further suspend my disbelief in this show, the plot holes are ridiculous, you have millions of dollars and advisors and outside help and years to create the final season and this is the result?A college student could have written a better script for the past two episodes.Pathetic and disappointing."
817,70,5,0,"Let me just say this.
Season 5 and 7 were considered ""bad"" by GoT standards. Season 8 so far, and this episode in particular, are ""bad"" by T.V standards. This isn't a bad GoT episode, it's actually a bad episode.
You get me?"
826,71,1,0,"Remember the multifaceted characters? Remember the show that broke the mold by having characters act as seemingly independent of the plot? Remember years of build up? I could go on but i assume other people will be more thorough with their rants. I guess this episode was what Varys has seen in the fire, I'd be terrified too."
827,71,1,0,So much time fans invested in this show ruined in just 3 weeks. It is so heartbreaking to see the show's declined in quality storytelling.Not even the millions spent in the production of this season can make up for that. And no wonder why so many of the actors cried when they read the scripts for the first time; to see the nonsensical mess the writers and HBO have made of GRRM's epic masterpiece
828,71,6,0,"Hard to use words to describe how much this show has changed. GOT became iconic because its complex characters drove the plot. You were shocked when you saw the red wedding or the origins of Hodor but you could trace it back to its origins. I'm not going to be extreme and have a huge go at this show because the truth is I'm saddened by its current path. Now we have characters being forced to fit within a plot, character development tossed aside as if it meant nothing.The story arc for Dany becoming the mad queen was not only forced it was illogical. Dany has been suffering her whole life and come out stronger, hard to believe a few recent bad turns would turn her mad. Lets also not forgot how the Night King and White Walker story line still remains the biggest missed opportunity. It was also anticlimatic to see Cersei die the way she did after all she's done. Shock value can only carry you so much. When season 8 started I said how are they going to wrap up this universe in 6 episodes. Now I'm thinking what's left?Drogon is a metaphor in a way. The city and buildings that he took down so fast without thinking can be how the show runners have mindlessly torn down years of character development, potential and fan goodwill."
847,72,1,0,"Well, they did subverted my expectations. That this would be satisfying in any way."
846,72,1,0,"There's a poetic justice to that.if you are considering getting into this show now, save yourself.and now my watch has ended."
845,72,1,0,It's like i wasted my time and energy to watch the show just to get this totally pathetic ending. I really don't have a words to explain how messed up with the ending. I wish i would give -ve ratings to this finale.
844,72,1,0,"We left behind a year in which the fans had been waiting a long time, ran from theories to theories, brainstormed and all expectations were destroyed in the 8th season. At some point, I can almost say that I was almost happy to say the series is over. Why does such a series end up so bad? Character development was ignored. Very big disappointment. It would be better if Drogon and Ghost made sex in the final.I would have preferred a finale that was left open but created a big effect. We didn't need to know what was happening to every character, that they were all happy and strong. Almost democracy was coming. I couldn't see the finale that was bittersweet. The creators of the series once again proved how unsuccessful they were without a source. You can see this difference in diplomatic sentences easily by opening a random episode from the first three to four seasons of the series. 1/10"
843,72,1,0,I used to rewatch GOT's all seasons every year. Season 8 killed any desire to come back to this show.

The show lost everything George R.R. Martin created - a complex world of utter fantasy and everyday life with politics, war strategies and basic human needs combined in a beautiful and authentic saga which you wish would never come to an end.
And the showrunners did everything in their power to ruin it. What a shame.3 stars for the music, actors' performance and a tearful last scene of Drogon with Dany."
10,0,7,0,"Incest, Death and Alcohol. All the ingredients for a perfect series (to some).The first episode of what now has turned out to be one of the most popular and most talked about tv-shows, shows us exactly why Game of Thrones has become this popular. From the great visuals of castles and a hauntingly scary forest. The only thing that is might pull someone away is all the characters that have been introduced. For what is meant to be an episode that shows off what the storyline is about. I feel like there are to many characters introduced in the first episode, it is very hard to keep up with the pace of the series, and for someone who doesn¨t watch many tv-shows , this massive introduction of characters gets way to hard to keep up with.For a first episode it was not perfect, but showing off great cinematics and a plot that is explorable to the max, Game of Thrones really showed a lot of potential for a big hitter."

Lord Stark also learns that his friend Jon Arryn, the Hand of the king, is dead and King Robert Baratheon, who is his friend, is traveling from the King's Landing to Winterfall to invite him to be his Hand of the King and travels with him to the capital. The King was betrothed to Lord Stark's sister but she died and he married Cersei Lannister, who has two brothers and a secret love affair. Meanwhile in the exile, the greedy Viserys Targaryen forces his sister Daenerys Targaryen to get married with the brutal warrior Khal Drogo since he needs an army to overthrow King Baratheon and take the power.""Winter Is Coming"" is the promising beginning of ""Game of Thrones"". The episode has stunning cinematography, very creepy and brutal scenes in the very beginning, betrayals and incestuous relationship. Many characters are introduced at the same time and it is quite confused to keep each name in mind. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Winter is Coming"""

836,72,2,0,"Man, every time I tell myself I'm over this show, something new about it pops out and I get sad, so I came back here to express how I felt a few months back when my favorite show crashed and burned into smithereens.I gave this show the benefit of the doubt so many times. People started doubting this show starting Season 5. I still gave it a chance. People started turning on it worse in Season 7, but I still stood tall for this show. I DEFENDED it through despite it's lows like Dorne, Sansa & Ramsay, Stannis, and title episode ""Beyond the Wall"", the Winterfell plot in S7, Littlefinger and whatnot because I put enough faith in David Beinoff and Dan Weiss to end this show beautifully because we were given 6-7ish good years of television. Why can't we now?Well, I got my answer in the worst way possible. I still can't believe the nosedive of the quality in the show. So much wrong for so many absurd reasons that it doesn't take any casual viewer with 2 brain cells to see what the hell is going on. I have never in my life seen so many characters ruined in just an hour and 30 minutes. It almost makes what M. Night Shalyman did with the Avatar The Last Airbender characters look good, and he BUTCHERED the characters from the original source. But my god, D&D...What the Hell were you thinking when you were writing this? That we'd enjoy it? That the fans would understand it made sense? I have made a few arguments in the past for some of the downtrodden plots/episodes of this show (Except Dorne and Sansa) but this season was a catastrophic failure and embarrassment to everything.From everything that has been coming out lately, you have been given so many chances. So many opportunities to make this better. And what did you do? You ignored it for the sake of that Disney money, which means NOTHING since you left that behind as well.
It doesn't matter if you don't care about this show anymore, MILLIONS of people including me have dedicated our Sundays in spring YEARLY to watch a new episode of this show that you were given the responsibility to take care of. You were quite literally handed the best cast ever, the most dedicated crew, MILLIONS of cash and endless resources to make this show great. To give people a debate whether Breaking Bad, The Sopranos, or Game of Thrones were the ""Best Shows of all time."" Matter of the fact is, we waited 8 long years to watch our investment pay off. To make sure our money was spent well. To make sure all of the endless conversations and research meant something to you. But it didn't.You broke the hearts of millions of fans around the world with that awful writing, and I will never watch a single thing that your names are on. Don't take those 2 stars I gave this episode in stride, for they are for GRRM and the hardworking crew and actors.The actors honestly had it the worst. Emilia, Conleth, Kit, Peter, Lena, Gwen and Nikolaj must've had it the worst. To have their beloved characters of 10 years of their lives be flushed down the toilet. To have their character sold out for cheap shock value. They deserved better.As for GRRM, It must've been sad for him to watch two nit wits destroy his life's work. He deserves better.WE the fans didn't deserve to have our money and time wasted by investing in this show. We deserve better.D&D, I dont care how many awards you guys get after this. Take that silly and undeserved ""Best Drama"" Emmy and go home and know that you both will go down in history for destroying this cultural landmark of a show and turning it into a meme made for mocking as everyone hangs their heads in shame talking about it. You guys blew it. And to add more salt to the wound, you can't even give your cast and (FORMER) fanbase the decent respect to give them an ending worth the near decade worth of investment into this series OR a proper explanation. Shame on both of you. Truly, shame on you both.(Edit/Update:) So it's May 2020, I'm currently in quarentine, and since I just binged all of the good shows I needed to catch up with and I currently have nothing better to watch, and I'm completely over my rage for GOT, I tried rewatching it for old times sake. My initial plan was to just stop at S6, but only 3 episodes into S1 and I HAD to quit. It's true, all it takes is one bad season to ruin an entire show. The entertainment value is shot. I'm watching and everytime the characters explain or tell a story about the lore of the universe all I can do is roll my eyes or yell at the TV and be reminded of how utterly useless everything that was established in the earlier seasons became in the final seasons. The legacy of this show is really ruined. Last year that was just my blind anger reviewing and speaking, now this is me talking from a calmer mindset than I was when the show ended. You can't even enjoy the GOOD seasons without being reminded of how useless everything became. There is no point to this show at all. This taint has carried over to the books for me as well because if the S8 ending is truly whats planned for the books, I don't want to waste my time. It's so sad now.Oh well, I wanted to just update my feelings about this show as we approach the one year anniversary of its disappointing conclusion. Mother's day last year was rage enticing for a lot of GOT fans since we watched the character assasinations of every remaining character on this show. Next week Sunday is the anniversary of this show's final destruction. Might as well give insight as to what the show looks like from fresh and calmer eyes a year later. Guys, it's not worth the rewatch at all.The best thing I can say about this show is that now, whenever you hate someone you can just recommend this show to them. Get them all invested to be disappointed by the time they spent binging and getting invested in the characters and stuff as a revenge tactic.I still stand by original rant review a year ago. My rating will remain at 2 stars just for sympathetic feelings towards the cast and crew. In my head, it's a -5 for D&D."
835,72,1,0,"I guess I'll never get over it. This was my favorite TV show ever. And the final season is pure garbage. Even the 7th season is awesome compared to this. I remember that I almost couldn't finish it.
D&D destroyed this amazing world that we loved and got so much invested in just because they got tired of it and wanted to move on and make money somewhere else. Total disgrace and spit in the face of the fans. The characters are immensely dumb, the dialogues are pure cringe. The whole thing is rushed and doesn't make any sense. The ending is the worst ending they could have possibly gone with and the last episode is so boring that it's almost unbelievable. I was just praying for it to be finally over when I was watching it.
The actors definitely did their best, but the script was so terrible that they couldn't save it no matter how hard they tried. That one star is for the incredible music by Ramin Djawadi, the only thing that stayed with us till the end and didn't disappoint. The music and the memes were the only good things about the last season. How sad is that?
If you're new to the show, don't even consider watching it. Seriously, just don't bother. Because the writers didn't bother either. In the end, you'll only be left with huge disappointment. In the end, nothing that was established in the previous seasons matters. Right after the final episode, I was filled with anger, asking myself how is this possible, how could HBO let this happen. Now, year and a half later, I'm just sad."

And I found the answer. I felt like after wonderful years in a beautiful relationship, the love of my life broke up with me. Suddenly. Via SMS. Without explaining anything. Without collecting their things.And I still find belongings here and there. And I'm still mourning and lovesick. It will take a while longer I guess..."

805,69,1,0,For something that was hyped up since season 1. This Episode was pathetic. Night King deserved better. So did we.
62,3,6,0,"This is again an episode that doesn't include big stuff (well, we've got a joust, that's something) or surprises in the plot, however, I still liked it more than the two before because there's not much that seems unnecessary in this episode. John Bradley, who plays the new guy at the Night's Watch, really exaggerated his role as this useless coward that gets bullied there and I thought they focused on this story too much. Therefore I'm glad that Jon Snow and the Night's Watch are completely absent in the next episode. But since they used the lots of scenes there to get the audience acquainted with the heavy life that lies ahead of Jon and his colleagues and they also portrayed his kindness very well, it was nothing that bored or actually annoyed me. Another character that gets way too much attention is Littlefinger, but that didn't bother me since Aidan Gillen plays him very interestingly. The other flaw of this episode would be some writing weaknesses since there are also a lot of changes to the novel in this episode. Lena Headey and Mark Addy really got too little screen time in this episode with the latter only having about two sentences in the whole 55 minutes, but I understand that it's not at all easy to include so many characters in every episode. The crew created a stunning visual style as always and I thought they did really well with exposing things and developing characters. The fight scene of Daenerys and Viserys would be the best example for this, though Harry Lloyd overacts his part just as in the episode before this one. I mean, we get that his character is both a jerk and a coward, he doesn't have to illustrate that in every single scene he's in. The outstanding scenes in this episode were Cersei and Ned's little conversation and Bran getting to do something again, while the outstanding cast members are rather hard to name. I would say that the women are more interesting in this episode, notably Michelle Fairley (who has a really great final scene with Peter Dinklage) and Emilia Clarke who both can really exhibit self-confidence."

442,33,3,0,"I have no idea how this episode is rated so high.The last episode (3) was already bad (destroying Jamies character with the rape), but this one is even worse.Why is it so bad? 1. Suddenly Jamie is good again - doesn't even fit to the episode before (well, at least he's more like the books again). 2. There is no action, no tension anymore they just serve you everything on a silver tablet, without ""presenting"" it properly (they just tell you like it's a site-note how Joffrey was killed, how they took Mereen, ...) 3. The story diverts (on a stupid way imho) even more from the books. Some may not see this as a negative point but I certainly do, for me it looks like they want to change it to bring more ""drama"" and ""action"" in (but as told in 2, they could just stop blabbling everything out). 4. They are actually ALREADY NOW spoilering things which did NOT happen in the books yet (but it's very very very likely that it WILL happen in the books...)A WARNING TO BOOK READERS:Do not watch the series any further if you want to stay spoiler free!"
441,33,4,0,"Well it started out okay, but the entire Nights Watch scene, which dominated the episode, was absolutely terrible. The entire story is completely fabricated (i.e. does not occur in the book), and it is such a ridicules story I just can't believe it. Who the heck wrote this? Not to mention the acting was pretty bad throughout these scenes.I understand that changes have to be made due to lack of time, to further the story, etc., and up till now I had no qualms with any of the changes, but this one was so bad, it really ruined the episode for me.I love this series, but this is the first time I did not enjoy an episode. Hope the next one is better."
67,3,4,0,"Reviews Of Unusual Size!Re: There's a joust, some detective work, brother and sister bickering and a dwarf in a tight spot.Outstanding: Like the previous episodes, number five has some great acting and sets. I'm consistently impressed with the King's Landing location, the grandeur with just the right amount of lived in feeling.Unacceptable: This episode felt pretty light on plot and I think part of that was the direction. The joust was woefully short and severely lacked the grandeur and spectacle it needed.Summary: A lot happened, but it felt like the whole episode was a waste of time. It was odd that as I watched it, I was enjoying everything but as the credits rolled, I felt like I hadn't watched anything worth remembering. The strains of a TV budget are showing a bit here and there, with the small, straggling Horde of Dothraki and the abbreviated joust.2/5"

61,3,6,0,"In the fourth (and for me weakest) episode so far, we are introduced to the self confessed coward Samwell Tarly (John Bradley) when he joins the wall. This is the first time we get any good scenes with Robb Stark (Richard Madden) and Theon Greyjoy (Alfie Allen). Both share good scenes with Tyrion. Tyrion Lannister is a great character and Peter Dinklage is truly a great actor who seems to being the best out in everyone. I'm glad Jamie Sives is given more to do as Jory in this episode and he shares a good scene with Jamie Lannister (Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau). We get another nice scene with Arya and Ned. Maisie Williams is simply stunning in her portrayal so far. Everything comes together perfectly in that scene. Not that Arya is the only one who has a moment to shine, Sophie Turner shared a good scene with Littlefinger (Aidan Gillen) at Tournament and there are several good scenes with Jon and Sam. Harry Lloyd remains in top form as the arrogant Viserys, who is quickly put in his place by his sister Daenerys (Emilia Clarke) the lovely Roxanne McKee who plays Dorea looks good and I hope to see more of her, and I'm really starting to warm to Iain Glen as Ser Jorah MormontOverall this episode wasn't as good as the precious three, but thanks to Tyrion finding himself in the wrong place at the wrong time. I'm still intrigued as to what will follow."
295,20,7,0,"The main thing that leaps out is how conversational this episode really is. There's not a great deal to say about it, when it deliberately avoids trying to sustain the momentum of last season's finale.It is a slow moving episode, I suspect the feeling of slowness has to do with the fact that there are no big surprises. Given the slower pace, what this episode is really about is the characters and re-establishing them and their relationships, both old and new. We have Tyrion and Tywin meeting once again. This scene is the highlight of the episode, as Dance and Dinklage get across the bitter reality of their family life. The scene with Cersei before it continues the trend of examining the family dynamic, and the actors do a fair job getting it across. Tyrion's wariness around his sister is well-deserved, especially when we consider the fact that on the show it's been suggested to Tyrion that Cersei herself was behind the attempt on his life.We do get our first look at Mance Rader, Tortmund, The Unsullied and Quyburn, a character who will go on to be very important.All in all, despite the quibbles, despite the disappointment in the introductions of the new characters whom book readers had anticipated so much, this was a solid start. Individually, most of the scenes hang well together, with the actors all in top form, and there's a good level of coherence. They avoided the pitfall of last year's opener, which was trying to catch up with every single character (plus giving significant time to a brand new region and characters in it), and so were able to give the scenes they did have just a bit more room to breath. It's only a shame that they loaded so much of last season's finale with the surprises and twists that could have opened this show, and given these scenes a sense of borrowed urgency simply by their juxtaposition wih the surprises that they could have had."
781,67,1,0,"What made GOT stand out was not the CGI, the cinematography and the action scenes that any show can have, it was the amazing writing, the complicated plot and the mysterious characters. The show was made special and different by the last three but instead of taking the time and effort to keep the show special, they dulled it down and took the easy way to make money.The writing is not just mediocre, it's straight up abysmal at this point and the trend continues downwards every season. I thought that at the end of last season that they'd learn and have taken an extra year and have much more time to improve their writing, no, it turn out that they did the opposite and spent even less time making a convincing and immersive story. The mysterious characters with multiple intentions are just trashed and everyone is bucketed into 'good' and 'bad' with no depth to the characters.The first 3 seasons of the show is GOT for me. The rest is a rushed product. I don't know how anyone can write this bad, you could have given the pen to any true GOT fan and they would have created a much more compelling tale than this garbage."
780,67,7,0,"Can't believe that there wasn't a single scene showing White Walkers. Did they just go to sleep or decide to chill after breaking down the Wall ? How did Tormund, Beric & the lot survive the pile of snow they would've been buried under ?Too many loopholes. Way too much focus on reunions.The only scenes I enjoyed were Dany-Jorah-Sam and then the Sam-Jon ones.Hopefully episode 2 onward, the episodes have drama, thrill and bloody WHITE WALKERS !!"
779,67,1,0,"Lazy writing, cheesy jokes, unemotional reunions and all round predictability. Everything I disliked about the latter stages of season 7 seems very prevalent in this episode, which has got me slightly worried. Feels more like a standard blockbuster than Game of Thrones recently. Really lacking any shock factor.Fingers crossed for the rest of the season."
778,67,1,0,"I've waited nearly 2 years for this !!!!!!!
At the middle of the episode i felt like I'm watching a lame Netflix show!!!!!"
777,67,5,0,"Didn't particularly like it. Feels like there was a lot of unimportant plot stuffing, and moments that were supposed to be meaningful were tarnished by shallow and fan-servicey writing. Some rather bad humour in this episode as well that didn't really fit the tone."
776,67,7,0,This episode is just full of fillers and forced reunions. Felt like a Disney drama sequence.
775,67,6,0,There is something missing since George R.R Martin left the show. I thought they would fix it in season 8. But it's pretty clear now that David benioff and D.B Weiss chose the easy road and the profitable one. Game of thrones sadly has lost its unique charming and has become one of those T.V shows with those poorly made love stories. I felt like I'm watching one of those Disney movies.
279,19,7,0,"Plot In A Paragraph: Brienne continues on her journey with Jaime. Arya receives a gift from Jaqen and Jon proves himself to Qhorin. Tyrion awakens to a very much changed situation at Kings Landing as King Joffrey doles out rewards to his subjects. As Theon prepares his men for battle at Winterfell, Luwin offers him some final advice. ""Blackwater"" was always going to be a very hard act to follow. The biggest battle ever seen on the show, written by George R.R. Martin himself. But as they rushed about from character to character trying to tie everything up it's a bit of a missed opportunity to end the season on a high point. It is not the worst episode the show has ever made, but it's a long way from being the best. Overall it's been a good second season, my favourite storyline was probably Arya's and my favourite scenes were the ones that featured Arya and Tywin Lannister, or Arya and Jaquen H'gar. (I hope that's not the last we see of him) Another obvious one is Tyrion's storyline. I have been very vocal about my love for Dinklage, his scenes with Varys and Bronn were a joy. Bronn (Jerome Flynn) quickly become a favourite of mine, his banter with Dinklage is excellent."
782,67,5,0,"With only 6 episodes left and after how season 7 panned out (everything moving at triple speed) I'm shocked at how much of a non-event this episode was. How can they rush through a whole season only to slow everything back down to a snails pace at the start of the next. It's inexplicable.It could be forgiven in part if anything that happened was remotely fun to watch but it wasn't. Some of the scenes and dialogue between characters was plain awful and embarrassing. As others have pointed out it felt like watching a completely different show in parts.I don't have much hope left for a decent ending at this rate. They had a chance to bounce back from the decline which started in season 5 but they've blown it.Regardless of what happens in the remaining episodes, there's no forgiving the rubbish we've had to endure getting there."
445,33,5,0,"Apart from the far from perfect storyline at this moment the biggest issue is Time ..... Each episode simply is too damn short to lessen the hunger that viewers have. We have several story lines and we all have our interests and favorite characters, but each episode only gives us so much, if they are featured at all. If you watch an episode now and think back you will realize that after 4 episodes so far ( and almost reaching half of this season) the story hasn't moved much nor have we seen any serious developments apart from the death of Joffrey.The story now moves at low speed leaving a lot of viewers with a hunger. A huge story like this with so many characters should feature episodes of at least 90 minutes each. This would pick up the pace and add some depth to the story itself and of course the characters."

The rest is the usual plots, this time evolving marriages for alliances. Theon is getting what he deserves. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""The Climb"""

All this build up and hype for nothing.
D&D knows nothing."
800,69,5,0,"Firstly, massive credit to the music composer for this episode, the music was absolutely perfect, but that was about it.
The visuals were great! But only on second viewing when having playback in 4k whilst also having the brightness on maximum, nobody could see what was going on at all throughout the episode if it wasn't in 4k quality, which is a horrible experience.
The writing was as if they got a 9 year old with no knowledge of game of thrones to write it, the army tactics were absolutely tragic and the amount of plot armour is actually unreal, screw the final battle against Cercie, just let Jon Snow run at the Lannister army all on his own, his plot armour will save him.Summarising, this was a gigantic middle finger to every single fan."

51,2,7,0,"In this third episode a lot more minor character development is made which I think was a good choice, only focusing on the big plot can make everything feel very shallow, so when this episode went into detail with specific characters it was a very enjoyable experience to watch. Almost a relaxer of what is to come..."
802,69,1,0,When a character can tell a better story than the actual show writers SMH. Complete waste of 8 years of build up and storytelling. So Disappointing.
799,69,6,0,"While I enjoyed the episode as I saw it, despite being so dark, those feelings immediately changed as soon as it ended and I felt like this wasn't the GoT I've come to love over the years. It pains me to say that I can't bring myself to be excited for the next episode.Considering the disappointing end to this whole White Walker part, I have a feeling that DnD will disappoint with the ending of the show itself as well."

In Winterfell, Theon discloses to Sansa that Ramsay has mutilated him and also that he has not killed her two brothers Bran and Rickon. Ramsey tries to convince his father to attack Stannis. Jon Snow and Tormund meet the Wildlings in their village and try to convince them to move to Castle Black, but only 5,000 of them accept the offer and embark in the ships. Out of the blue, they are attacked by the wights and White Walkers. ""Hardhome"" is probably the best episode of ""Game of Thrones"" so far with an unforgettable and exciting battle. All the segments are important and interesting but the fight between the Wildlings and the Night's Watch against the wights and the White Walkers is the best sequence ever. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): Hardhome"
584,47,10,1,"Greetings from Lithuania.Episode 7 was good, not great, but good. There were some plot developments as usual, plot moves forward, but nothing that good. Sure, costumer, set design, acting is at their best, but something was missing. Episode 8 gave us FINALLY that missing piece. WOW was the first word that came to my mind after witnessing this piece of art. Won't going to spoil anything, but this is hands down the best episode of season 5, and one of the very best of the entire show - it is THAT good. There were many great written exchanges in this episode, very strong acting us usual, and what an outcome. Sure, it's not the outcome yet, but what a spectacular, superbly directed, shoot sequence at the end. Kudos to all involved, terrific sequence, probably to big to wittiness it on a small screen - what other shows do something like that?Overall, Episode 7 gets 8/10, and Episode 8 pure 10/10. ""I think we are fxxxed"" - that is probably was the first thought that came to John Snow's mind at the very end of this sequence."
587,47,10,1,Definitely one of the best battles from the worst season
537,42,9,1,"After two slightly slow episodes, this season of Game of Thrones is picking up full speed. Now the storylines are really starting to engage me."

Sansa begins to follow the Machiavellian plot of Little Finger to retrieve the lands of her family. Arya is finally accepted to serve the Many-Faced God. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""High Sparrow"""
538,42,8,1,"High Sparrow doesn't quite live up to the high standards left by the first two episodes due to the pacing dragging a bit longer and the plot progression, while well-written, isn't furthered, but it makes up for it with some solid performances from the new characters and setting up the events that would later happen in the next seven episodes.The storyline, despite how slow it got, is still good as is the script, the performances from the original cast are still solid especially from Arya and Daenerys, the music score is still beautiful, the scenery is still gorgeous, the sets and costumes continue to be lavish, the directing and editing is still sharp, and the characters continue to be interesting in their relationships as did the new characters.Overall, not excellent, but a solid episode for season 5."
585,47,10,1,"well..i don't know were to begin. I mean the is one of the finest hour of television that i have witnessed until now. i don't know what people say about season 5 being the least best among all the seasons, but i can surely tell you that all the starting episodes were made for the character development and for a great build up which has finally paid of in this episode. I cant call it just an episode because it was an experience. The best thing in the episode was the long stare between the walker leader and Jon snow, i mean it was one of the most intense scenes one could witness in their whole lives. those who have not watched the episode and is reading my review , i can assure you one thing, IT WILL BE THE GREATEST HOUR YOU WOULD HAVE EVER SPENT WATCHING TELEVISION AND I MEAN IT."
582,47,10,1,"This episode was pure epicness in any way. It was an adrenaline rushed action packed with perfect narrative and brilliant acting. This series can only be better, an that's fact. I am still trembling and shaking because of what I've seen. Game of Thrones have all kind of stories we love from intrigues, love, adventure, epicness to horror, and thats why it is the best show in TV history.+Tyrion & Dany very dynamic story with perfect introduction of whats to follow.+Sansa and Theon story progression; Fine acting as usual.+Valyrian steel and John sword ;)+Cersei in a difficult situation. Perfect acting.+Spokes on a wheel. Effective monologue.+Winter and horror. Glimpse of future chaos. Definitely proved that chaos isn't a ladder...only pit! Cool scene at the end. My score: 10/10 if I could give it more I definitely would! Pure brilliance."
580,47,10,1,"The last 25 minutes is one of the BEST things I have seen. Brilliant directing, cinematography, acting and visual effects. Mesmerizing chaos. Better than any horror/thriller/action movie out there. Bravo!"
581,47,10,1,"Holy bananza, this episode took me by surprise. i wasn't expecting this epic battle, the writers have finally delivered some amazing action in this slow paced season. for me, this season was the weakest, but thank god for this episode, this is probably the best episode in the whole show, it has everything you ever wanted in Game of Thrones and more. heck, the last 20 minutes was one of the best things i've ever seen in TV history. for all the people who gave up on Game of Thrones because of the 5th season, you don't know what you're missing!. only Two episodes left, hope the writers continue with this amazing work. can't wait another week!"
578,46,10,1,I like the bit where tirion and jora are sold as slaves
563,45,8,1,"Well, it was definitely one of the weakest episodes of Game of Thrones.The Arya's part was nicely visualized but was not interesting as far as written content goes, the story of that part is becoming quite boring and at times one asks what the hell is going on and why? A prefect example of excessive mystery and low content which leads to irritation.The kings landing is still good, littlefinger is acting extra smart with his artifice and Cersei still believes she is extra smart. The faith part is fine as well.The Tyrion part was a bit weird in the humor area. The Dorne part was unpleasant as far as fight sequence and acting of the sand snakes go, the dialogues were made even cheesier when delivered by the sand snakes. I wish they had taken in the right actresses and good choreographers or focused on other good characters left. They could have focused on Euron Greyjoy, casted Timothy Gibbs perhaps.As far as Sansa part goes, one should know that violence is a part of the world which game of thrones encompasses and men or women, no one is immune to it, many characters have suffered a gruesome fate.Those who have seen the episodes sincerely and without prejudice will never complain that only female characters suffer or have suffered in this show. I am seriously upset that fans were angry about the last scene, what Ramsay did was expected of him, he isn't a noble man and Sansa was never the most clever or strong character, in other words after Ned's death it was a character which was a subject to other's will, and most of the time it never had much power over itself due to the situations she was in.However, the thing which is becoming more and more irritatingly frequent with game of thrones is the cheap cliffhanger thing in the end which looks quite artificial. It seems like it's done just to shock in the end and frankly it looks and feels quite cheesy.I will give it 8 because when you compare it with other TV shows, it is still better and they shockingly and easily score 8 or 9 here."
564,45,10,1,I like the bit where they talked about the size of a dwarf Willy
535,42,9,1,"So Jaime and Daenerys took the week off but the show's quality absolutely did not. It was another week with several great character moments and a great example of just how good this show is with spreading the love to the entire cast. We learned more about the House of Black and White, saw new journeys for Sansa and Tyrion, and had many short but important moments with everyone else.The episode started with Arya doing the dirty work at the house and in turn had to basically give up her name as her first step of training. Throwing her clothes, coin, and nearly her sword into the water was pretty emotional. It just goes to show how long we have been following Arya and how much that sword meant to her. But it was fun to see Arya go off on that one girl and say some words I don't know that we have ever heard her say. We then were taken to the bedroom of Tommen and Margaery. It's clear that the latter doesn't have as much feelings as the former does. It's also clear that the actor sounds so much like Joffrey did and it was quite apparent tonight. Margaery also had a great scene with Cersei in which not a lot was said, but there was a lot that came out of it. Cersei is quickly falling down the ladders of power and Margaery is rising ever so fast. That scene clearly showed those two in their new and improved season 5 form.We then traveled north to visit Sansa and Littlefinger. Finding out that he was planning on having Sansa marry Ramsey was heartbreaking. She has been through arguably the most out of any character on the show and to land with a psychopath like him is tough to see. I hope there are better things to come for Lady Stark. Perhaps Brienne, who is just a few miles out comes in for the rescue? Speaking of Brienne of Tarth, her scene with Podrick reminded us of Stannis' faults and what the man is capable of. But I would like to think he has the best intentions. Once again him and Jon Snow had the best scenes of the episode with the ladder having to reject his offer. Stannis wasn't too pleased but realizes the honor in staying as the leader of the night watch. But as Stannis said, that honor got Ned Stark killed. Even at the end of the episode when Snow stands up and executes that man, it had shades of Ned in season 1. And it definitely mirrored Dany's issues last week.We ended with Tyrion in his quest to head to Meeren and find Dany. To be honest, it's so cool to even hear him say her name out loud. I have to imagine the book readers geek out over that. It's just as fun to watch Varys and Tyrion ride together for a long period of time. The line of ""I'm losing my mind"" or even ""I need to speak to someone with hair"" were hilarious. And finally we find Jorah, who looks to be on the edge, only to take Tyrion prisoner with the line of ""I'm taking you to the queen"". Having not read the books, I'm really interested to see how this plays out. Jorah is not on good terms with Dany and throwing Tyrion in there makes it all the more unpredictable. No matter, I'm definitely looking forward to next week as we are nearly one third of the way into season 5 already! +Arya learning the ways of being no one+Snow & Stannis scenes +Tyrion-Varys banter +Jorah pops up +Queen shift in power -Sansa's endgame seems frustrating 9.0/10"
579,46,9,1,Stuff happened Sunday night. Lots of stuff. Stuff that hasn't even happened in the books yet. So much stuff that I'm not even going to complain that the showrunners actually crammed entirely too much stuff into one episode.
569,45,10,1,This is the best episode of this season so far. This season started with slow pace. Ramsay Bolton is becoming new joeffry baratheon. Sansa stark is really one unlucky woman when it comes to marriage. The final scenes are really unbearable to watch.
568,45,10,1,"This episode is near the top of my list. We have several issues in motion. The biggest fact is that there is no invulnerability among any characters. Tyrion is no at the mercy of slave traders and Jorah is infected. Both are in about as tenuous situation as there can be. Cersei has embraced the Sparrows and has taken on Margery full force, having her cast into prison. She is still ruling the kingdom and Tommen is just a little boy, hopelessly out of his league. Theon still has a bit of nobility in him (though he always was a coward) and may have been pushed to the brink. Sansa has been given to Ramsay and he is doing what he always does. He is a delightfully awful character whom we grow to hate with each passing minute. Then there is the princess who has embraced her new life in a far off land and has fallen in love with a suitor. She is going to be hard to rescue, since her saviors are now captured and she is so resistant to being rescued. With Circei back home, one can only imagine. Also, Littlefinger has made a packed with the evil queen mother for his own gain. She is putting a lot of eggs in his basket. The closing scene is terrifying, but only because of the buildup. So many have suffered throughout this story, so Sansa is not going to walk through everything unscathed. Can't wait for the next episode."
536,42,8,1,"People are being subversive, planning and conniving. We begin with the marriage of Tommen and Margery. She is such a beautiful, sensual woman, but that sly smile speaks volumes. She has had an agenda for a long time, and now she is the queen. Cersei is relegated to a subservient role, sort of like the queen mother of England. The strength she has, however, is in her alliances. We can't forget that she is a cruel despot who has struck off the heads of many who have crossed her. Margery is planting seeds of dissent and playing Tommen for the child he is. She now wants total control of the castle, hoping to drive Cersei back to her original home. Lots is going on. Arya is now in the House of Black and White, where she is to become some kind of Jedi warrior. She is bossed around by a kind of Christ-like figure who demands she leave her identity behind. Where she is going and what she is to do is a mystery to us. John Snow has been give power and uses it in an act that would have been anathema before. We know it's necessary, but has it spoiled him. Littlefinger maneuvers Sansa into a marriage with a psychopath for political gain. Tyrion oversteps his bounds and this sets up Episode 4."
586,47,10,1,"Is this the best episode of Game of Thrones ever? So far shock value has been the cause of a lot of positive reviews in episodes that were, OK, but not great.This episode however is not like that, it doesn't rely on shock or surprise, it is well written, well put together and for me the best episode of the season by a long way. Possibly too, of the entire GOT show.I am SOIAF book reader, and I know that this series has been, (mostly) way off the events that are portrayed in the books, but many key elements are in place on this episode, such as Arya's development, Cercei's story, and the re-emergence of the real enemy.I love the additions to the storyline that develop with this episode, it is both very entertaining, and very intuitive of the TV writers. Hats off to them.So to conclude, this may well be the best episode or GOT so far, along with, (in my opinion), 'The The Rains of Castamere' and 'Blackwater' Watch it, and decide for yourselves."
540,42,8,1,"Came to 'Game of Thrones' fairly late in the game and due to being so busy the binge-watching was gradual. Have found myself truly loving the show, very quickly becoming one of my favourites. It totally lives up to the hype and not only does it do the brilliant source material justice (a rarity in television) it is on its own merits one of the finest, most addictive and consistently compelling shows in recent years and quality-wise it puts a lot of films in recent years to shame.There is less of a still settling feel here in ""High Sparrow"" than there was in particular the Season 5 opener ""The Wars to Come"", as far as previous episodes of the season go, which is a good thing. By all means, it doesn't fully explode, it is not the most action packed or pace-wise exciting of episodes and in comparison to other episodes not a lot feels like it's progressing forward. ""High Sparrow"" nonetheless scores very highly in making the characters interesting, the very adept handling of weaving all the different subplots together and introducing new characters and events promisingly set up. The standouts here are the High Sparrow introduction and the whole storyline with Jon, which has a lot of tense unpredictability.All the acting is strong, 'Game of Thrones' always delivers when it comes to the acting. Maisie Williams, Emilia Clarke and Kit Harrington in particular.Visually, ""High Sparrow"" looks amazing, as one would expect for 'Game of Thrones'. The scenery is throughout spectacular, the sets are hugely atmospheric and beautiful on the eyes with a real meticulous eye for detail and the costumes suit the characters to a tee. The make-up is beautifully done. The visual effects are some of the best of any television programme and are not overused or abused, the scale, the detail and how they actually have character and soul are better than those in a lot of the big-budget blockbusters. As well the cinematography and editing, which are cinematic quality as well.One cannot talk about ""High Sparrow"" without mentioning the thematically, orchestrally and atmospherically multi-layered music scoring and the unforgettable main theme. Again, worthy of a high-budget fantasy/action/drama film.It is hard not to be bowled over by the quality of the writing, outstanding isn't a strong enough adjective to describe how good the writing is once again. It always has a natural flow, is layered and thought-provoking and demonstrates a wide range of emotions. The story is still riveting, with plenty of passion and sensitivity.To sum up, a very good high flying episode indeed but not a 'Game of Thrones' favourite. 8/10 Bethany Cox"
554,43,8,1,"The final battle scene is worth the price of admission, and the Sand Snakes looks as lethal as advertised, but I'm getting awfully tired of Stannis & Co. trying to convince Jon to muster the Night's Watch to march on Winterfell."
553,43,8,1,"That was a classic episode with the one sided fight at the start, the lovely tall elegant Sansa Stark scene in the middle (God to think she has to hook up with you know who) and the internecine fight at the end with the tolling bell to great effect. It was brilliant. I watched this series at the start, got a bit browned off with the some of gratuitous sex scenes and the demise of so many of the Starks and the burgeoning careers of the Lanisters, so I failed to watch some of the middle series episodes. Now look at Jaime Lannister he's semi reformed character. I thought it was predictable but now I find this fifth season to be a return to form!"
573,45,9,1,"I really loved how female centric this episode was. If only Daenerys was in it to legitimize it even more. And for the most part, it exemplified strong character moments for all of our favorite female characters. It turned out to be one of if not the best episode of the season so far. Game of Thrones has always been great at giving us backstabbing moments that actually make sense and don't feel forced, and I feel like this was a perfect example of an episode that focused on it. Plus, this episode definitely felt like the first step into the absolute chaotic second half of the season.We began in Braavos where Arya continued her training into becoming no one. Even though Arya has probably had the least amount of screen-time out of the main cast members this year, her scenes at the House of Black and White have felt tedious. With that being said, the dungeon of heads or whatever was pretty cool. And I was glad to see that it seems as though her training is picking up a bit. Speaking of the Starks, Sansa had a big night, but not necessarily a good one. Anytime the show has a wedding, I get nervous for the characters. I half expected to Brienne to break up the party, or maybe even Theon. But what I was really hoping for was Theon killing Ramsay while he raped Sansa. It was heartbreaking watching Sansa go through something like that after all she has been through, and Theon's face seemed to signal him helping her. But she did have a great scene with Myranda in which she completely out smarted her and I'm sure eventually will prove that she will not be one of those 'dumb girls'.Baelish arrived at Kings Landing to set another one of his schemes in motion. When he revealed to Cersei that Sansa was still alive, I thought for a second that he had bad intentions but in typical Baelish form, he had more up his sleeve. This time he wants to be named Warden of the North. That's something I would be okay with, as long as the Bolton's get what they deserve. Meanwhile, Cersei once again plotted against Margaery. It's been fun all season watching the two go at matching blows week to week. Putting her on trial with her brother for having homosexual experiences is pretty brutal. And it shows us again just how little power Tommen actually has.Onto our favorite road trip duos, Tyrion and Jorah bonded over their father issues, that is until they were captured by slavers. I feel like the whole being 'captured on a road trip' thing is getting a bit annoying but at least the slavers are headed towards Meereen. If anything else, tonight was a great episode for these two and their scenes erase the brutal final scene. Where's Varys when we need him? Jaimie and Bronn arrived but ended up in a battle with the strange sand snakes. Bronn was another character I thought may kick the bucket tonight, thankfully he did not, and gave us the hilarious 'oh for fuc** sake line'. So now being over half way through the season, I'm very excited to see how the season ends. And hopefully the show delivers on many of the promises it's seemingly making.+Road trip duos +Cersei vs Margaery +Baelish plots again +Bronn +Arya getting closer -Theon should have redeemed himself -I felt Dany's absence 9.1/10"
551,43,10,1,Another exciting episode with lots of action and a great story
550,43,8,1,"We have Sansa at the Boltons ready to marry that psychotic for the good of the future. We have Tyrion heading for the Dragon Queen. His captor carrying his own baggage. Dany lets her emotions get the best of her, being corrupted, for the time being, by her own ego. John has gone to get reinforcements from the Wildings to attack the Boltons. Things are all gray at the moment with everything in the offing. Most of the characters are faced with the problem of how to rule in a world so divided. Should they put it all out there and conquer, knowing that this keeps the undercurrents alive. One factor that is going to be a big time issue is the threat of the dragons which are at times pretty unpredictable. Also, with Sansa, is her marriage going to be honored in any way. The traditions dictate things but blood usually prevails anyway."
574,46,10,1,"Came to 'Game of Thrones' fairly late in the game and due to being so busy the binge-watching was gradual.

Up to this point however, ""The Gift"" is the best and a big improvement over the polarising (and to me well done episode hampered by the stuff with the Sand Snakes) ""Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken"".What are the reasons for my saying this? It's the tightest paced episode up to this point in Season 5, it's the most jam-packed (in a good way, a lot happens but it doesn't feel too much), long awaited answers are provided and the character and story development show the most signs compared to the previous Season 5 episodes of moving forward rather than reiterating or feeling like filler. ""The Gift"" and ""Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken"" as well deserve credit for making Sansa the most interesting she's been in a long time and making me see Theon in a different light, instead of being the nasty piece of work he was previously part of me felt for him. There is a lot of intrigue and suspense, Tyrion and Jorah's storyline is very entertaining and the action is neatly executed. Actually found myself emotionally invested and interested in the Dorne storyline and the nudity in the prison scene was a non-issue.'Game of Thrones' always delivers on the acting. ""The Gift"" is no exception and can find no casting issues. Peter Dinklage, Nikolaj Coster-Waldau and Diana Rigg are particularly exemplary.Visually, ""The Gift"" looks amazing, as one would expect for 'Game of Thrones'. The scenery is throughout spectacular, the sets are hugely atmospheric and beautiful on the eyes with a real meticulous eye for detail and the costumes suit the characters to a tee. The make-up is beautifully done. As well the cinematography and editing, which are cinematic quality as well.One cannot talk about ""The Gift"" without mentioning the thematically, orchestrally and atmospherically multi-layered music scoring and the unforgettable main theme. Again, worthy of a high-budget fantasy/action/drama film.Script-wise, throughout the humour, mystery, wide emotional ranges and thought-provoking layers are present and the storytelling is passionate and sensitive. Overall, wonderful episode and one of Season 5's best. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
549,43,8,1,"Sons of the Harpy is another solid that delivered what it promised. The performances are still great, the sets and costumes are still lavish, the music score is still beautiful, the directing remains a bit atmospheric, the editing is still nice, the characters and relationships still shine, and the script is still well-written. My only quibbles is that the pacing felt even more slower and the plot progression hasn't been advanced even further. Despite those flaws, however, it's still a good episode and I hope everything would turn out fine in the next few episodes. So, overall, not great, but still solid. :)"
555,44,9,1,"The focus begins with Dany, whose miscalculations and ego have caused great distress. She begins by trying to rule through fear. She brings in the city's family leaders. She feeds one of them to the dragons, a horror filled scene. We don't know at this point if the carnage will continue, or if she is making a point. At first it appears to be the former. Things change however. The most interesting story takes us back to Theon and Ramsey, the utter psychotic ""possible"" son. He is totally evil, embracing the fear of everyone. He is also a coward because he has only accomplished things through his being shielded by his power base. He abuses women and plays psychological games with Sansa. He knows that she is vulnerable. She has grown some and believes that Littlefinger will do something to help her, but we will see how much this trust is worth. The forces under John Snow and his people amass and head out to face the Boltons. In a nice hook, we have Jorah hoping to appease the Dragon Lady with Tyrion. Unfortunately, they are accosted by the people who have become savages because of greyscale. The concluding scene sets up an interesting road ahead."
556,44,8,1,"Kill the Boy isn't as excellent as I hoped much like the previous episode, but it's still solid. Yes, the plot progression is still too slow and hasn't been advanced further and not to mention the new characters haven't been given anything to do. Despite those issues, however, everything still turned out fine.The performances are still good, the script, despite how the slow the plot has been so far, is still well-written, the music score is still great, the scenery is still gorgeous, the sets and costumes are still nice, the directing is crisp, and the editing is smooth. So, overall, another solid episode in spite of it's slow pacing. :)"

All the previous Season 5 episodes were very good to great, especially ""Sons of the Harpy"" (the biggest, boldest and most brutal), but it was that episode that felt the most settled. This is continued with the halfway point episode ""Kill the Boy"".""Kill the Boy"" is not as big, as bold, as violent, as surprising or as crisp, but it's far from dull and never less than interesting even with the slower pace and more intimate atmosphere. Do wish that the newer characters had more to do and that there was more to Sansa's character. Having said that, there is a good amount of insightful character development still, compelling drama and very promising story progression, it actually does feel like things are moving forward.'Game of Thrones' has never failed to deliver on the acting.

""Sons of the Harpy"" manages to be even better than them, while not one of my favourite 'Game of Thrones' episodes or one of the show's magnum opuses, it was with this episode where Season 5 started to properly settle. While there is evidence of the quieter and intricate tone seen in the previous three episodes, ""Sons of the Harpy"" balances that and brilliantly with brutally bold action, insightful characterisation and development (the one possible exception being Sansa, who the episode could have done more with), surprising twists and revelations and drama that feels intense and emotional. Of the four episodes, it is with ""Sons of the Harpy"" where it felt the most like the storytelling and characterisation were evolving and moving forward.'Game of Thrones' has never failed to deliver on the acting. ""Sons of the Harpy"" doesn't disappoint in that regard with strong performances across the board, regardless of any reservations with Sansa it to me doesn't lie with Sophie Turner but merely that the character pales in comparison to stronger characters that have had more development and exposure.Visually, ""Sons of the Harpy"" looks amazing, as one would expect for 'Game of Thrones'.

562,44,8,1,This Episode show us a lot of alliance & new relationships between characters. and it contained with a lot of pointless scene. at least this episode continue the story. with a one big death in the end.
575,46,9,1,This episode represents a turn for the worse for some of the characters - but there's also some newfound light in the darkness.
576,46,10,1,"After the controversial Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken, The Gift is a very satisfying episode that improves on the first six episodes. It does a neat job advancing the plot progression while making the relationships remain interesting. Plus it has some action in it which is really cool to watch. And no, there aren't any problems I have with this episode because it's great to see things getting better than ever.The performances are still great, the characters are still believable, the pacing never drags and doesn't become uneven, the story/script improves on the weak writing that episode six had, the directing and editing is still sharp, the music score from Ramin Djawadi continues to be beautifully atmospheric, the action is really cool to watch and the plot progression, like I said before, is advanced very neatly.So, overall, a classic episode and an improvement over Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken, which I thought was pretty good, but not without it's flaws. :)"
558,44,10,1,One of my favourite episodes of all time. Theon has a great role
545,43,8,1,"Jorah Mormont steals a boat to navigate with Tyrion. James and Bronn travel in a merchant ship to Dorne to rescue Myrcella. The Iron Bank is charging their loan and Cersei sends a representative of the Small Council to negotiate with the bankers. Then she has a meeting with the High Sparrow and gives an army and power to his followers to kill and destroy ""the sinners"", including Little Finger's brothel, his clients and Sir Loras, the brother of Margaery. Tommen unsuccessfully tries to release Loras to send him to the Castle of Casterly Rock. Margaery leaves him to stay with her family. Stannis Baratheon plans to head to Winterfell before the snow. Jon Snow is summoning nobles to help the Night Watch with men and supplies and he has a dilemma with the name of the Bolton family. Melisandre tries to seduce Jon Snow, but he resists to the temptation and does not break his vows. Shireen meets her father feeling bored and rejected and he tells what happened to her when she was a child. Sansa visits the tombs of her ancestral and Little Finger tells a story of her family to her and tells that he will meet Cersei. Further, he tells that the best men can be manipulated and he is the master of manipulation. James and Bronn are found by a patrol and need to fight to survive. Ellaria Sand wants war but she is warned that James Lannister and Bronn are in her lands. Daenerys has a meeting with Barristan and then she does not accept the traditional games. The Sons of Harpy promote a slaughter and trap Daenerys' army.""Sons of Harpy' is one of the most brutal episodes of ""Game of Thrones"". The segments are very violent, beginning with the fanatic followers of the High Sparrow and ending with the Sons of Harpy. In-between, Castle Black is preparing for war and Ellaria wants to begin a war. The beautiful part is Stannis Baratheon having a conversation with his daughter. The preparation of Sansa by her manipulative mentor is the impressive Machiavellian part of the show. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Sons of Harpy"""
544,43,9,1,"God this show is good. They simply deliver on so many things that people want it's insane. The two road trips were great as we caught up with of Jaimie and Tyrion are doing. We got the beginnings of some serious battles between Daenerys and the Sons of the Harpy, and more progress in Cersei and Snow's respected endeavors. It was a fantastic episode, and probably my favorite of the season so far.Jaimie and Bronn together were so entertaining. It's fascinating to think about how much Jaimie has changed since season 1. When he says he wants to die in the arms of the woman he love, I actually think that's about Brienne. As crazy as it is to think it's not Cerseii, I just think he feels more obligated to Cerseii instead of where his legitimate feelings lie. It's also unlikely he will hurt Tyrion, that's more of him just covering up his tracks to Bronn. Speaking of Cerseii, her scenes this week mostly lied with the council and the High Sparrow. The council is a lot smaller than it used to be and I think it was once a lot better. Arresting Loras was right up Cerseii's alley and it's just another reason for Margaery to hate her. Watching Tommen try to free him was very entertaining. He is such a naïve boy and completely whipped towards Margaery. What a man would do for his woman, huh? Onto the north, Stannis sees a lot in Jon Snow, but apparently so does Melisandre. Was I the only one who was legitimately wanting to yell at the screen to tell him to resist her? Snow also had to sign for Bolton unwillingly. It was heartbreaking to know that he had to sign that agreement knowing everything that Bolton had done to his family. I hope now that Baelish is planning for an alliance with Stannis, we get to see Sansa reunited with Jon. The Starks need some happy moments. Considering we got a heartwarming scene with Stannis and his daughter, I think they are repositioning him as a good guy on this show.The last 10 minutes of the show or so were dedicated to Tyrion and Jorah's trip to Daenerys. Glad to see that he was indeed taking him to Meereen instead of King's Landing. By the preview next week, we may be getting our first interaction between the two, EVER. The Sons of the Harpy fight at the end was done really well, and it just gave us more of a reason to need Tyrion and his wit. Dany is losing so much, and now presumably both Barristan and Grey Worm? Harsh times ahead for her. It may be awhile before we see her on the Iron Throne.+Road trips +Tommen and his immaturity +Sons of the Harpy +Snow and his honor +Baelish reveals some plans +Next week's possibilities...-Screw Melisandre! 9.5/10"
560,44,8,1,"With all due respect to George R.R. Martin, leeway with the books has made Game of Thrones Season 5 the most consequential yet, and ""Kill the Boy"" set yet another strong precedent."
577,46,9,1,The character and the story line ruin the show! Somebody needs to chop off High Sparrow's head. What a dork!
543,42,8,1,There are not much to talk about. just building to the end of season.
542,42,9,1,"The transformation from Arya Stark to No One is quite emotional to watch, but we're happy Arya gets a new costume this season - she's been in those brown rags far too long."
561,44,8,1,"This episode gives me a slight intermission vibe - but it's a quite entertaining intermission, so that's fine with me."
541,42,10,1,Another exciting episode with lots of action and a great story
547,43,9,1,The storylines flow effortlessly forward and we get some nice foreshadowing - and some inconspicuous insight into an important backstory.
546,43,9,1,"Greetings from Lithuania.So we are almost in the middle of season 5, and last two episodes were better that first two in my opinion. I would rate both of them 9. First off all both of them were longer in running time - that's a good thing. There were also more action, although action is just one of the parts (and not the most important) which makes this show great. Plot is moving to interesting directions, and while there some stops here and there, overall i'm intrigued.Overall, episodes 3 and 4 were superior then first two. Bigger, bloodier, more intriguing. At this point we are still far from end of season 5, but something tels (no i haven't read books, so i'm fresh here) me that this season is going to be more of buildup for future events. I kinda had this idea first when they announced directors for season 5 and there weren't ""heavyweighter"" from previous seasons. Sure, there will be meaningful events, but so far everything is moving not very fast and more on a buildup level. Still, this is a great show so far no matter what direction it goes."
492,38,10,1,"With the jaw dropping events of last week, it was hard to visualize another installment so impactful, as to stand up with the series much revered ninth episodes. But my word, does the Watchers on the Wall, the battle from two fronts deliver! Taking place all at Castle Black, the episode allows it self to build up so much tension and suspense that I may have forgotten to breathe. Boasting one of the series most, and arguably best battle sequences to date, director Neil Marshall delivers perfectly the four year build up, surpassing his efforts in season 2's Blackwater. The battle is central to the episode, but also delivers on character interactions and reinvests your interest in the happenings at the Wall. The best part of this episode however is following Jon, Sam, Ygritte, Tormund, Styr, Gilly, Ser Alliser Thorne and all the others as they fight for different things around them and within themselves. It nice to focus on the Men of the Nights Watch, and really makes you feel that all the backstabbing and games at the capitol,are. well. games. Everyone has been telling us that winter is coming for so long I almost stopped believing them, but The Watchers on the Wall reminded me once again that Game of Thrones always delivers, always surprises, and ALWAYS satisfies. One of the best 10/10"
532,41,8,1,"Like the previous episode there are some nice scenes, but I still don't think the season has gained momentum yet."
474,36,8,1,"Season 4, episode 7. Tyrion tried to find a champion and Oberyn Martell answers his call. The Hound gets hurt, Arya causes him problems but helps to heal him. Brienne and Pod meet Hot Pie and find out that Arya lives, discusses Arya and Sansa's whereabouts. Littlefinger kisses Sansa while her mad aunt looks on. 8.5/10"
475,36,8,1,"This was a very full episode of Game of Thrones. Aside from a weak interlude in Dragonstone, all of the various plotlines were very engaging as the performers once again elevated their game."
476,36,9,1,"Story (5/5)Moving Forward.
Soundtrack (4/5)Dialog (5/5)Graphic (4/5)Reasonableness (4/5)Entertainment (5/5)A lot of ohhhhh moment in this episode.
Overall (4.5/5)"
477,37,10,1,"Amazing episode. I think as good or better than ""The Laws of Gods and Men"". The last 3 episodes of this season are definitely going to be a crazy ride, and this episode starts it off. Like almost every episode this features great acting and dialogue, but this also has a couple great action scenes. All the plays and events from this season and really the entire series, are coming together and things are going to places I could have never seen coming. It is amazing to think back on what many characters used to be like in the beginning of the series, and what they are like now. This episode is really going to make you emotionally exhausted from the events you are about to witness. This show has always screwed with my emotions and this episode is no different and is pretty unpredictable. This episode is one of the most intense episodes of the series. It is going to be a long week waiting for the next episode and I can't wait to see where the final two episodes go from here."
478,37,9,1,"There's been a lot of epic episodes in season 4, but this one takes the cake. Some viewers have expressed being turned off by the violence, but time for them to wake up, this is exactly like it happens in the book. And I for one applaud it when the show copies the book word for word, scene by scene. The final show down in this episode is exactly as it is written on the page. They speak the exact same dialog from the book too. And yes, it is shocking, yes it is violent, welcome to Game of Thrones. It's when the show departs from the book, that the quality lowers. There's been a fair few moments like that in this season. But not this episode. Good for them for not trimming any of the violence as it was in the book. It needs to be this shocking for it to work. That is what makes the scene great.There's also some incredibly good dialogs, and foreshadowing of future events in this episode. Like Arya's discussion with the Hound about the use of poison, or Littlefinger's remark how some people die on their chamberpot. The book readers are more likely to pick up on these subtle nods to things that are still to come. There's even some early foreshadowing by Prince Oberyn himself before the fight starts. It's just a very clever episode. And we still have two more epic episodes to come before this season is over."
479,37,10,1,"This episode was mind boggling. Even having read the books, seeing the events unfold in real time, was just amazing. Sansa seemed to have finally caught up to the game of thrones world, while a heartbreaking truth was revealed to Dany. Arya and the hound had a short but a memorable scene and the Grey Worm scene was a fun side scene. Poor Tyrion is expected to watch his champions fight for both their and Tyrion's life. The last five minutes were intense and the ending was one of the most shocking and gruesome that had only been achieved previously by The Red Wedding. Hopefully poor Jon Snow will be able to handle the wrath that is about to come to the wall. 10/10 for this episode."
480,37,10,1,Best episode ever!Fight between mountain and martels was great and ended in a really unexpected way!
481,37,10,1,"The Mountain and the Viper is another classic episode for Game of Thrones. Not only is it as interesting as I thought, but it advances the story lines left in the previous episode including the story-arc for Tyrion if he can either be spared or sentenced to death and the ending is really suspenseful.The performances are still compelling, the storyline/script is well-written, the music score is great and suits the combat sequence really well, the writing is superb, the characters are still believable, the pacing, once again, never drags, the directing and editing is even sharper, and the scenery and sets is really solid. Also, the combat sequence is well-choreographed. So, overall, another epic episode and great set-up for the last two episodes. :)"
482,37,10,1,"Came to 'Game of Thrones' fairly late in the game and due to being so busy the binge-watching was gradual. Have found myself truly loving the show, very quickly becoming one of my favourites. It totally lives up to the hype and not only does it do the brilliant source material justice (a rarity in television) it is on its own merits one of the finest, most addictive and consistently compelling shows in recent years and quality-wise it puts a lot of films in recent years to shame.Season 4 was a great season with none of the episodes being less than very good. Even thought ""Oathkeeper"" was great, regardless of its treatment of the source material that upset a number of fans. ""The Mountain and the Viper"" is another example of Season 4 and 'Game of Thrones' overall being on peak form, while having a marginal preference for ""The Lion and the Rose"" and ""The Laws of Gods and Men"" as far as previous episodes go. The final fight scene is the most touted scene of ""The Mountain and the Viper"" and often considered an episode highlight. No wonder, it is full of intensity and suspense, if not for the squeamish (it is one of the show's most gruesome scenes up to this point), and is then capped off with a shocking twist that leaves fans aghast and anxious to see the next episode.But it's not just that scene. The interplay between Daeneys and Jorah has a subtle tension and engrosses and Littlefinger and Tyrion are awesome. As always with 'Game of Thrones', the acting is superb. Pedro Pascal, Aidan Gillen and Peter Dinklage are particular knockouts though Charles Dance and Emilia Clarke are also excellent.Visually, ""The Mountain and the Viper"" looks amazing, as one would expect for 'Game of Thrones'. The scenery is throughout spectacular, the sets are hugely atmospheric and beautiful on the eyes with a real meticulous eye for detail and the costumes suit the characters to a tee. The make-up is beautifully done. The visual effects are some of the best of any television programme and are not overused or abused, the scale, the detail and how they actually have character and soul are better than those in a lot of the big-budget blockbusters. As well the cinematography and editing, which are cinematic quality as well.One cannot talk about ""The Mountain and the Viper"" without mentioning the thematically, orchestrally and atmospherically multi-layered music scoring and the unforgettable main theme. Again, worthy of a high-budget fantasy/action/drama film.It is hard not to be bowled over by the quality of the writing, outstanding isn't a strong enough adjective to describe how good the writing is once again. It always has a natural flow, is layered and thought-provoking and demonstrates a wide range of emotions such as suspenseful tension, poignant pathos and witty humour. The story is paced beautifully, structured with such nuance and attention to coherence, a high emotional level and is done with intelligence, passion and sensitivity.Summing up, 'Game of Thrones' does it again with another Season 4 winner. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
483,37,10,1,Part of Game of Thrones' excellence has been in managing to maintain huge suspense and excitement in spite of the fact that many millions of viewers who have read the books already know what's coming up.
484,37,10,1,"Episode 8 of season 4 was as amazing as we expected it to be. Emotionally exhausting, it certainly kept me on my toes. It combined thrilling action with impressive acting and raging emotion. It certainly is one of the best-if not the best so far-and serves as a promise that the last two episodes of the season are going to be breathtaking.The most important thing is probably the fact that this episode involves some of the most intense and emotionally charged scenes in the history of Game of Thrones. Despite having read the books, it still made my skin crawl in anticipation. It certainly caused an adrenaline rush!"
485,38,10,1,"I've even seen episodes like Rains of Castamere, Hardhome and Battle of the Bastards. Although for me, they are very close to be the best, I am just want to be honest with myself. This episode ain't even one of the top episodes but this gave me one of the breathtaking moments I'd experienced. It keeps you on edge of your seat. I even clapped on some moments on this episode and also after it ended.It shows the best battles and the outstanding direction by Neil Marshall. This episode is very underrated for me. But all of us have different taste and opinions so we and the best thing to do is enjoy this very amazing show."
486,38,10,1,"The anticipation for this battle has been a long time coming, and it didn't let me down at all. Features a very intense battle , with amazing fight scenes. I enjoyed this personally more than any of the other battle scenes. A couple of great dialogue scenes as the calm before the storm, before the battle begins. With how this show has been about not being shy about killing off anyone, it really makes it so intense in that you feel any and all the characters are really in danger. The battle lasts for the majority of the episode and doesn't slow up from the time it begins, until it ends.This episode has some of the most amazing visuals and sets so far on Game of thrones. With all of the giants and creatures we have been teased with, you really get to see all of it this episode. It has a long continuous shot towards the end of the battle which was pretty awesome as well. The finale next Sunday should finish off, in my opinion, the best season yet."
487,38,10,1,"I'm pretty sure that the story on The Wall is not one of the big favorites for most fans of the show. And it makes sense. There really hasn't been anything that truly stands out story-wise in terms of The Wall. Jon Snow has always been a well-liked character, but widely considered a boring one. It also didn't help that this episode immediately followed the epic end to the last episode, and I'm sure all fans are dying to find out what happens to Tyrion, so being forced to wait a week longer than they had hoped does not help. And that's part of why I was so excited for this one. I feel like this is a turning point in the storyline for Jon and The Night's Watch. From here on things are only going to get more interesting from here. The episode itself completely surpassed my expectations. Like the amazing Blackwater episode, this was another episode that revolved simply around a battle, The Battle of Castle Black. And boy was it a doozy. My heart was pumping fast from start to finish, which is definitely a sign of amazing television. Also, not only were there big action moments, but also amazing character moments for the likes Jon and Sam, and even some of the less important characters throughout like Pyp and Grenn. I also loved (and was sad) at the way Jon and Ygritte's reunion was done, and Ser Alliser proving that while he may be a dick, he's a good leader, unlike that cowardly Janos Slynt. Personally, I think that things are only going to get even more exciting for the storyline here at The Wall. The ending definitely left more to be seen for this storyline to come next episode, and book readers know that something's coming next episode that will completely change the current way things are in the Night's Watch. Overall, an amazing and action- packed episode at The Wall that I also think has served as set up for even more awesome things to come for this storyline. Also, this episode living up to the expectations of being the BIG Penultimate episode of the season (Season 1: Ned's beheading, Season 2: Blackwater, Season 3: Red Wedding) proves once again why Game of Thrones is simply the best show on TV right now."
488,38,10,1,"Oh man, this one is certainly out of this world. The cinematography and choreography are on their own level, man. They're breathtaking, seriously jaw dropping. There are so many highlights regarding this episode, from its emotion to the battle scenes to its ending to the action-violence mayhem, some great dialogue, visuals, writing/plot, structure, and great directing, it makes for a strong and promising episode. Some scenes are particularly sad and heartfelt and captures its dramatic and melancholic essence so well. The battle between the Men of the Night's Watch and the Wildlings is utterly superb, seriously its own level of awesome. If you thought Blackwater was great, which it is, then this is just as good if not better. Acting is solid and there are some great scenes with chemistry between Sam and Jon, Jon and Ygritte, etc. Ollie has to ruin everything the idiot. This might be my joint favourite episode of the season and it's in my top ten Game of Thrones episodes. Ever. Jon Snow truly shines and stands out as the best in this one, heroic and strong. Up until this episode alone, this is a top five in the series. You gotta see it, even just for the last 20-25 minutes alone because it's bewildering entertainment. Truly epic."
473,36,10,1,Another exciting episode with lots of action and a great story
472,36,10,1,"Came to 'Game of Thrones' fairly late in the game and due to being so busy the binge-watching was gradual. Have found myself truly loving the show, very quickly becoming one of my favourites. It totally lives up to the hype and not only does it do the brilliant source material justice (a rarity in television) it is on its own merits one of the finest, most addictive and consistently compelling shows in recent years and quality-wise it puts a lot of films in recent years to shame.Season 4 was a great season with none of the episodes being less than very good. Even thought ""Oathkeeper"" was great, regardless of its treatment of the source material that upset a number of fans. Alongside ""The Lion and the Rose"" and ""The Laws of Gods and Men"", ""Mockingbird"" is one of the season's best. ""Mockingbird"" does mainly set up what is to follow, and it does that brilliantly. But it doesn't feel like an episode that does just that and nothing else, there is much more to ""Mockingbird"" than just set up and filler. It is also an episode that is surprising, suspenseful and emotional with a good deal going on without feeling that there is too much of it. Although all the cast are superb, with not a weak link, once again Peter Dinklage is particularly brilliant. His performance may not quite be the powerhouse than in ""The Laws of Gods and Men"", but Dinklage does prove why he is a fan favourite and one of the main reasons why 'Game of Thrones' is as popular as it is.Visually, ""Mockingbird"" looks amazing, as one would expect for 'Game of Thrones'. The scenery is throughout spectacular, the sets are hugely atmospheric and beautiful on the eyes with a real meticulous eye for detail and the costumes suit the characters to a tee.

471,36,8,1,"It's another good episode, with several interesting scenes. But as a whole it seems to lack some momentum."
470,36,9,1,"My goodness this is a great series! It is amazing that when an episode isn't as good as another, it is still better than just about everything else on TV. Of course, the focus is Tyrion, who must now find a champion, someone who is willing to risk his life for the little guy. Jaime has already laid into him for his rant against Cersei and Tyrin and the betrayal of Shae. You can't blame them when you see the giant they are going to have to face. Meanwhile, Sansa and Littlefinger are finding their ways at the Ayrie with that goofball woman and her wimpy son. Arya and the Hound are the odd couple. He is attacked and bitten and this is going to be something we know is going to have an issue with. His fear of fire is possibly going to be the death of him. Dany get in the sack with her new guy. Brienne is without a doubt one of the neatest characters. She is showing some weakness at times. She and Pod must really appear strange together."
452,34,10,1,Another exciting episode with lots of action and a great story
455,35,10,1,"I have really enjoyed this season of Game of Thrones, more so than the previous 3. And it's because of episodes like this.The Laws of Gods and Men has topped the previous episode as Season 4's Best so far. We get everything in this. Action, Blood, Brimming tension, BRAVOS and some powerful, heartbreaking character moments. The pacing of this episode was consistent, the multiple plots have surprisingly yet to fall flat, with the audience getting some more Reek, if a little too much for our tastes in a deliciously creepy scene.Oh, and i have found that Peter Dinklage's (Tyrion Lannister) performances have been a little too familiar in the past season and a half, but boy didn't he bring it all to the table here. It was a compelling and powerful performance by Dinklage that made the final 10 minutes of this episode some of the most satisfying of the series.On a whole, this is Game of Thrones at it's best. Sharp Dialogue. Tense action sequences, Stunning Special effects (for a television production) and a powerful ending. A Masterclass. Peter Dinklage... WELCOME BACK!"
456,35,10,1,"I don't have time to write much about this episode. However I loved it! One thing to remember though: The three last minutes of this episode was rhetorically and emotionally the best actors performance I have seen in years. These moments will make Peter Dinklage very famous! Nothing more to say apart that this actor will have a prosperous future, if he can stand on this level of performance. Not only his strength of speech, also his mimic and the passion of showing emotions was fascinating. If I have to imagine that this acting performance was shown in a series... my god... lots of actors still have to train so much in movies. 10 thumbs up!"
457,35,10,1,"Great Episode. In my opinion, the best of the season. Game of thrones is an extremely complex series with a substantial number of characters and stories to tell. In this episode things seem to take a large dramatic step and things really started to heat up. Several of the main characters make major plays and things fall into place from events set in motion long ago. The writing for this series is so well written how they develop their characters into such great depth and they continue to become more complex and interesting. One of those in particular took such a dark dramatic turn from what it once was in the beginning of the series. The last 15 minutes of this episode alone makes it one of the best and features some of the best dialogue, writing and especially acting of the series."
458,35,10,1,"Finally, he gets to do what he is best at. Tyrion Lannister is a fighter, stood against all odds and smarter than anyone in the seven kingdoms! The episode was something ""edge of the seat"" thing. Unlike previous episodes of the season, this brings to the fore a more character in the GOT. Good to see the Bravvos for the first time and a power packed performance by Ser Davos, a brilliant & convincing speech. The episode was a delight, in short!! Looking & hoping ahead more episodes matching the same standards. Besides setting a benchmark for the forthcoming episodes, this one has also given an indication, yet making it extremely secretive, of what lies ahead..yes!! More drama and more suspense, and I bet no TV series has ever gone this far to make its audience cling to their seats and waiting for Sundays to come. I could not resist thinking of what would be the next turn of events...I am not an ardent watcher of the serials but GOT has really got me this time for which I would be glad for my entire life. Tyrion you are all time favorite man!!!"
459,35,10,1,"Best episode. The writing, the directing, the intense drama and most of all the standout acting by Peter Dinklage makes this episode the best of the season. Thoroughly improvised, so I've heard, and beautifully written. Shae delivers the performance of her role and gives the proper support to Tyrion Lannister's breakout scene. It's exciting to see the events that lead on from this episode. Tyrion's outburst is the highlight of the entire episode. On the other side we see The City of Braavos.A must-watch episode of the series.10/10"
460,35,10,1,"It's very sad to come here after nearly 5 years to say this about the show, this season was the golden age of the show and this episode is its peak, sorry to say that. the show started to decline after that until the catastrophe of season 8 :( . love these days"
489,38,10,1,"Over the past 3 seasons, the 9th episode of Game Of thrones has always delivered something tantalizing. Something grueling or heartbreaking or down-right epic. And 'The Watchers on the Wall', the 9th episode of Season 4 most certainly kept this tradition going, with an incredible episode.From the start, the unshakable sense of dread makes you nervy, i mean really. This battle has been building up since the first season. And boy, it delivered. It was a mighty spectacle to behold. The action sequences were some of the best this show has ever had. The epic nature of this episode is unrelenting. It was at times powerful and heartbreaking at the same time. It really did deliver. Neil Marshall, who also made season 2's battle of Black-water showed us that he is the go to man for large scale chaos. To put it simply, Season 4 of Game of Thrones has easily been the best season. And it's because of episodes like this. Transcending the boundaries of television to bring us quality like this. It is truly Unforgettable."
461,35,10,1,"The Laws of Gods and Men is where things started to get real in this season! Not only is it even better than the last three episodes, which were great but not nearly as excellent as the first two, but it raises the stakes for Tyrion Lannister to either be proved guilty or innocent after the death of King Joffrey in episode 2. Take for instance, the court scene where Peter Dinklage gives out the most epic speech in the entire show with this quote.""I will not give my life for Joffrey's murder. And I know I'll get no justice here. So I will let the gods decide my fate. I demand a trial by combat."" That line made this whole episode worth it. Everything else is still awesome. The storyline and script are still well-written, the dialog is even more compelling, the pacing's tight, the directing is fresh, the scenery and sets are still lavish, the characters and the relationships still shine, and the music score particularly in the background scene in the court is terrific. So, overall, another classic episode thanks to Peter Dinklage's epic performance."
463,35,10,1,"The end Great!!!!!!!!!!, just woooooooooooooooooooow"

Also one of the magnum opuses of all 'Game of Thrones' episodes, along with ""Baelor"", ""Blackwater"" and ""The Rains of Castamere"" as far as previous episodes of 'Game of Thrones' go.While the whole episode and its various storylines is thoroughly absorbing, with the right amount of tension and emotional impact (like with the whole stuff with Yara), it's Tyrion's trial that has been the most talked about scene for good reason. Not just one of Season 4's best scenes, Tyrion's speech being absolutely earth-shattering in its power and one is with him every step of the way, but one of the best in 'Game of Thrones' history from personal opinion. All the performances are uniformly excellent, but it's the phenomenal powerhouse that is Peter Dinklage is the one who burns into the memory and in a different league to everybody and anything else. While he was nominated for an Emmy for his performance, he should have won it.
Visually, ""The Laws of Gods and Men"" looks amazing, as one would expect for 'Game of Thrones'.

465,35,9,1,"Our dwarf brother is again the target of his own family. He rests in prison until Jaime comes to see him. Jaime tells him that if he pleads for his life, he will be saved and put in the guard to live out his days. He shows himself to be a man of great resolve and integrity when those who have been true to him (and vise versa) look out for their own butts. His own father presides and, as is the case with kangaroo courts, allows him no defense. Even Shae is brought in to testify against him. Meanwhile Jaime seems filled with guilt and anger. We all know that his father has no care for any of his children, only his own lineage.We get to see the Iron Bank and how Stanis is able to get money from there. We also have to wonder what Theon/Reek is being asked to do after he has been brutalized into losing his identity; now dead to his sister who tried to save him, he is going to become a force of some kind. He will now play Theon, who, for now, he's never heard of. News of Dany and her forces (and dragons) is becoming common knowledge to the Lannisters and is a force to be reckoned with. Very well done episode."
466,36,9,1,"A very good episode which features some great dialogue exchanges and really grabs and holds your interest for the duration of the episode. Along with the previous episode, major decisions and events were set into motion and we will see the results in the final three episodes. Game of thrones never really has simple transitional or filler episodes, and this definitely is not either. Two of my favorite characters are heavily featured in this episode. The first sees an opportunity to try and right some of the wrongs of his past and makes complete sense looking back on everything this season and I'm sure many even saw this coming. The other, probably the most devious mastermind of them all (in my opinion), is constantly manipulating everything and everyone around him for his own personal current and future advancement. Nothing is ever as it seems with this character, and the only thing you can predict with him is that he will make himself better off. By the end of this episode you will may become a little angry due to the fact that you have to wait a week until the next episode. I for one cannot wait to watch these next three episodes play out, it should be one wild ride!"
467,36,10,1,"No Spoilers ahead!!After his great speech in the last episode, and on his demand of trial by combat, Tyrion is rescued to his cell. Jaime comes to meet him there and tells him how he's lost this golden opportunity to live out of the trial. But Tyrion says that he'll not join the castle for a crime he's not committed. Then they discuss about who's going to fight for the crown and who for Tyrion. I'll stop here about it. In Meereen, things are going to change a little bit. The Hound is having some tough time along with Arya. Brienne and Podrik are wondering where Sansa might be and they meet an old companion of Arya in their way. And ""the mockingbird"" is a special treat for you to watch! Not gonna spoil that!Once again, Peter Dinklage succeeds in sending chills down your spines with his brilliant acting along with an extremely brilliant background score. This episode is directed by Alik Sakharov, who won an emmy for his brilliant cinematography in the TV series 'Rome'. Here again, some shots will leave you mesmerized. This is the one episode of this season, where many ""important"" things happen. And I mean really really important. Watch out."
468,36,10,1,"Mockingbird is another classic episode. Not only does it live up to the previous episode in a compelling way, but it raises the stakes to what would happen if one person can win the combat to either spare Tyrion or sentence him to death.The storyline's still compelling, the writing is still superb, the performances still shine especially Peter Dinklage who continues to make Tyrion Lannister more believable, the pacing's great and never drags, the editing and directing are sharp and crisp, the scenery and sets along with the costumes are still neat, and the music score from Ramin Djawadi is even more terrific and suited the combat sequence really well the same way he did for the action in the previous episode. So, overall, another classic episode that engaged me. Thumbs up! :)"
469,36,10,1,This episode again steals the show with the awesome acting of Peter Dinklage and Maisie Williams.Although some of the characters seems to be weak but the story line keeps you the the edge of the seat.Also the ability of GRRM to create the suspense and end it in the most unexpected way makes us feel that he is unique in the art of story telling.The reappearance of the red-women Malisandre and her dialog pushes the story deeper and to more complicated plots.The number of different plots also increases but its admirable that the director has managed to keep most of them covered in this episode.The twists are bloomed by the previous episodes content.The link of the episode to unexpected characters makes it more interesting.All the acts and scenes prove their significance with its epitomized direction.The chemistry of Daario adds to some extent of unsatisfaction but is well handled by Jorah.The only thing that I think is missing in this episode is the absence of Bran and company.But at the end it was perfect with the masterstroke of LittleFinger.Viva la GOT!!!!
462,35,10,1,"Episode #6 was 'the best' episode of all the seasons of Game of Thrones. It was a sensational speech by Tyrion in his defense. It was simply out of this world, fabulous speech. I felt goose bumps like never before. I have put up a wallpaper on my laptop, on my phone, on my tablet of: ""If Tyrion dies, we all will riot"" Hail Tyrion!!. There has never been such a great show ever before on this Earth. Game of Thrones smashes all the records of other shows as expected. I would like see no end to this show, it should run eternally. I hope Tyrion gets justice and the sinner gets his punishment. But most of all the things I am relieved is that now King Joffery is dead, he was no way near of title, 'A Noble King'"
533,41,8,1,Almost nothing new in this episode. Story is moving forward without surprise. But i like the Cercei's part.
490,38,10,1,After the very bad last 2 seasons I began to appreciate the first 6 seasons and especially this episode wow I think I lost count for the amount of times that I watched this episode I loved every second of it
588,47,10,1,One of the best things ever shown on tv!no need to say more!
515,40,9,1,"Now that I've reviewed four seasons, this episode and some of the later episodes of season 5 is where I watched Game of Thrones on television. Because, like I said before when I reviewed Season 1, I had to catch up with the entire show online. So, with that out of the way, time to review Season 5 starting with this one.The Wars to Come continues where Season 4 left off with the two Stark girls heading off in different directions Arya and Sansa while Tyrion with the help of Varys arrive at Pentos after escaping from the Lannister family after being sentenced to death. Also, Jon Snow is continuing his duties at the Wall before two kings arrive, which finds himself caught.The first episode of Season 5 is a great episode. The performances are still good, the storyline's nicely written, the new characters are well-introduced, and the pacing never drags. My only quibble is that it doesn't quite live up to the high standards set by Season 4.Don't get me wrong. The writing's fine for the most part, but the reason I think Season 4 was the best because it raised the stakes to the events that would happen to some of the Lannister family members, the action sequences were engaging, the writing had gotten progressively stronger, and the character development was even more fleshed out.But while this episode isn't excellent, it's a great start to season 5 and looking forward to see how things will turn out."
516,40,9,1,"As RavenGlamDVDCollector, I am not really here for the story, No, I am that pseudo stage-door-Johnny bringing flowers for the actresses. But I must speak up, give credit where credit is also due.Much of my contributions for IMDb is usually before having seen the entire episode, and I noticed that other reviewer going ""disappointing start, nothing significant happens"" and at about midway, I kinda saw it was down from the previous season, thought this bit of me having jumped (however belatedly) onto the GAME OF THRONES bandwagon, full fury and throng, well, now it's past the apex anyway, like other reviewers say, bah...Fortunately though, turns out, not the case...This show does something IMMENSELY right. Look, I'm here for the actresses. I joined up for the beauty of Emilia Clarke. GAME OF THRONES was suggested to me by a friend who showed me a sneak preview in the knowledge I'd flip my lid. You get the picture, I'm sure you do.But I've recently had one of my few deviations in my reviews when I praised Peter Dinklage's performance in that episode last season, his confrontation in court with Tywin. I've just realized that something similar happened here. This is all about respect.Mance Rayder wasn't even that much liked by myself up till now, but I'm glad to report that on a freezing cold winter's morning (I call it my GAME OF THRONES Winter Is Coming The Wall Sensurround), here I sit with tears in my eyes. Like Ser Allister, when the chips were down, this guy really showed how to fly the flag.You will have to watch for yourself. I'm not giving the outcome away.A powerful word is invoked here. Respect. This show, through sparse scenes with a vast multitude of characters, achieves greatness beyond what I could possibly convey. These characters, whether good or bad, that doesn't matter... They're destined to be immortal legends in this modern classic.Coming from me, here for the actresses, much, much impressed by these stellar performances, this is the HIGHEST RECOMMENDATION.So scr*w the other reviewer... :)"
517,40,8,1,"The episode starts off well, but to me it doesn't really pick up enough speed. I find it a good, but not great start of the new season."
518,40,8,1,"Came to 'Game of Thrones' fairly late in the game and due to being so busy the binge-watching was gradual. Have found myself truly loving the show, very quickly becoming one of my favourites. It totally lives up to the hype and not only does it do the brilliant source material justice (a rarity in television) it is on its own merits one of the finest, most addictive and consistently compelling shows in recent years and quality-wise it puts a lot of films in recent years to shame.""The Wars to Come"", while not living up to the previous season's finale ""The Children"", is a very promising start for Season 5. It is not the most dramatic, action-packed, story-advancing or most emotion-filled of episodes, instead going the slower, more reflective and intimate approach. This is not a problem because, although some may disagree, 'Game of Thrones' has shown numerous times that it does these types of episodes excellently. Some characters are better developed than others, Tyrion continues to have plenty of meat to him and is getting more fascinating with each episode. Am also really appreciating Cersei getting more development and becoming more prominent. Sansa is rather bland though.The episode does a great job beginning where the previous season left off, reminding us of what happened and sets things up for what is to follow. There is not a massive amount in terms of character progression however, though it's certainly evident if not quite deep enough, and other episodes have done better in moving things forward.'Game of Thrones' has always been strong when it comes to acting and ""The Wars to Come"" is not an exception. Peter Dinklage can do no wrong, he is a fan favourite for great reason, and Lena Headey, Aidan Gillen and Emilia Clarke also do a huge amount with their characters.Visually, ""The Wars to Come"" looks amazing, as one would expect for 'Game of Thrones'. The scenery is throughout spectacular, the sets are hugely atmospheric and beautiful on the eyes with a real meticulous eye for detail and the costumes suit the characters to a tee. The make-up is beautifully done. The visual effects are some of the best of any television programme and are not overused or abused, the scale, the detail and how they actually have character and soul are better than those in a lot of the big-budget blockbusters. As well the cinematography and editing, which are cinematic quality as well.One cannot talk about ""The Wars to Come"" without mentioning the thematically, orchestrally and atmospherically multi-layered music scoring and the unforgettable main theme. Again, worthy of a high-budget fantasy/action/drama film.It is hard not to be bowled over by the quality of the writing, outstanding isn't a strong enough adjective to describe how good the writing is once again. It always has a natural flow, is layered and thought-provoking and demonstrates a wide range of emotions. The story is still riveting, even with the quieter and slower approach to the storytelling, and has enough passion and sensitivity. Overall, promising start to Season 5. 8/10 Bethany Cox"
519,40,9,1,"I was a fan of ""Game of thrones"" first season. After death of Eddard Stark (Sean Bean) I lost previous interest for some reasons, mostly because of huge number of characters and subplots. I watched all the seasons but not joyfully. I was planning to continue watching like this, but something happened.The day before season 5 premiere I watched ""Game of thrones: a day in life"". It is a behind the scene short movie. Great amount of accessories and number of cast & crew was astonishing. I was really impressed which changed my point of view.Besides, although there is no ""previously on..."" in s5 e1 but, wisely, the past events are narrated by characters, for example death of Tyrion's mistress by himself and so on just in time. We also see all of main characters except Arya (Lord Stark daughter), I guess. Game of thrones fifth season had a powerful beginning. I wish (and I am sure) all the fans will be satisfied"
520,40,8,1,"A lot of new character's purpose, story are moving forward and building up to the War to come."
521,40,9,1,This episode is very good one of the best in season 5
522,41,8,1,"Greetings from Lithuania.Both first episodes of season 5 are 8/10 in my opinion. While the story haven't moved drastically or very intriguingly, it's still a show to wait and to admire. The production values here are like no other - you can simply watch this show for production values - they are truly create this rich world.Acting was as usually very solid from everyone involved. Directing is good, but this show has seen better, as well as writing. It's good, but not as good as it gets and this show has featured some series that were as good as they could possibly be.Overall, season 5 started good, but not great. I know that it's a slow burner start which will definitely lead us to a great and unforgettable moments, so it has to build it on something, and this ""something"" are these first two episodes."
523,41,9,1,"It's quite clear that this show has been about the struggle for power, and it always has been. But I really like the episodes that particularly focus on that. Jon Snow, (possibly Jon Stark?), is somewhat unwillingly to take on another leadership role. Cersei struggles with the council, Tyrion misses the power, and Daenerys grapples with the right punishments. Even though there wasn't a whole lot of action, I loved tonight's episode. It was another one of the great dialogue episodes that the writers consistently give us. Whether it was Tyrion and Varys talking about the lack of power and what people do with it, or Stannis continuing to tempt Snow with possible leadership titles, it was a well written and directed episode.Arya arrived in Braavos to the House of Black and White only to find her old pal Jaqen H'gar! Obviously not reading any of the books I was quite pleasantly surprised to see him appear for the first time since season 2. Speaking of Starks, Brienne finally met Sansa Stark. Sadly, much like Arya, she wasn't too open to her protection. You have to feel for Brienne. She has spent the last few years trying to find the Stark girls and yet neither of them welcomed her. Fingers crossed they change their mind in the future. Jaime and Bronn are apparently on a trip to retrieve Myrcella from the Viper's wife and brother. I'm starting to really like these unlikely duos that go on adventures together. Brienne and Jaime, The Hound and Arya, and now Jaime and Bronn.It was once again really fun to watch Jon Snow and Stannis in the same scene. The characters that you grow to care about for seasons finally meeting is extremely fulfilling. Which is why it will be incredibly once Dany and Tyrion meet. Dany is really struggling with her power and the problem of the Sons of the Harpy. I would hope Tyrion and Varys would fill the gap that Jorah has left Dany in helping with the many political decisions that go along with leading these people. Hopefully next week will be that week.+Stannis & Snow's interactions +Power struggle +Unlikely duos +H'gars return -Brienne can't catch a break 9.0/10"
524,41,9,1,"There is more jockeying for position in this episode. Our favorite Dwarf continues to feel sorry for himself, not seeing what he had become. He has betrayed his own integrity. We know, of course, that when the pity party is over, he is the person with the most character in the entire series. The Queen mother continues to overstep her bounds and is not getting an easy path, but she really wields a lot of power and is filled with venom. John Snow continues to move toward a place of equality. His bastard status haunts him and he now can remove it if he only sells himself out. A big question ahead. Arya has finally been brought to her destination, but she isn't sure what is going to happen. Littlefinger meets Brienne and needs to realize that she is incredibly committed to her vows, even though she has been mistreated all along. He, her adversary, should know that one who puts fear aside becomes incredibly dangerous. Dany may have made a great misstep but she feels she must maintain her power position. She now turns to fear. A really intriguing episode."
525,41,8,1,"Arya Stark sails to Braavos and arrives at the House of Black and White to seek out Jaqen H'ghar; however she is not welcomed to enter in the house and she throws her coin away into the sea. Brienne and Podrick are eating in a tavern and she contacts Sansa and Little Finger, but Sansa refuses to follow Brienne. The men that are escorting Little Finger and Sansa unsuccessfully hunt Brienne and Podrick down on the road. Cersei shows to Jaime that their daughter Myrcella is in danger and Jaime seeks out Bronn and makes an offer for him to travel with him to Dome. In Meereen, the Son of Harpy is captured and Daenerys has a meeting with her leaders to decide his fate. Barristan advises her to give a fair trial to the man; however Mossador disrespects her order and kills the Son of Harpy. Daenerys sentences him to death and there is a riot in Meereen. Jon Snow is invited by Stannis Baratheon to serve him; in return, he would give the North to Jon and he would be Jon Stark, Lord of Winterfell. But Job Snow turns the invitation down and he is chosen to be the new Commander of the Night Watch. Arya is finally invited to come to the House of Black and White.by Jaqen H'ghar. ""The House of Black and White"" is the preamble of the Fifth Season. The destiny of Arya in Braavos is a mystery. Sansa seems to be lost following Little Finger. The journey of Jaime and Bronn will certainly be full of action. Daenerys is following the path of her father. Let's see how Jon Snow will deal with Janos and Alliser Thorne. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""The House of Black and White"""
526,41,9,1,"Came to 'Game of Thrones' fairly late in the game and due to being so busy the binge-watching was gradual. Have found myself truly loving the show, very quickly becoming one of my favourites. It totally lives up to the hype and not only does it do the brilliant source material justice (a rarity in television) it is on its own merits one of the finest, most addictive and consistently compelling shows in recent years and quality-wise it puts a lot of films in recent years to shame.There are still signs of settling, understandably, with Season 5's second episode ""The House of Black and White"", but it is an improvement over the still very promising and well done season opener ""The Wars to Come"". It is a very daunting task living up to the consistently exceptionally high standard of Season 4 and this very early stage of Season 5 is doing a noble job on that front. What makes ""The House of Black and White"" a superior episode is that there is a bigger and bolder approach to the storytelling, rather than the slower, quieter and reflective tone of ""The Wars to Come"". There are more and bigger character moments (especially with Jon Snow and Brienne), characters having moral complexities, intensity-building and there is more emotion and drama. A better job is done advancing the story and character progressions while building upon the events of ""The Wars to Come"". Loved that there was more of Arya and Bronn, neither wasted, and Dorne is a worthy addition. All the acting is never less than very strong, can't think of a weak link here.Visually, ""The House of Black and White"" looks amazing, as one would expect for 'Game of Thrones'. The scenery is throughout spectacular, the sets are hugely atmospheric and beautiful on the eyes with a real meticulous eye for detail and the costumes suit the characters to a tee. The make-up is beautifully done. The visual effects are some of the best of any television programme and are not overused or abused, the scale, the detail and how they actually have character and soul are better than those in a lot of the big-budget blockbusters. As well the cinematography and editing, which are cinematic quality as well.One cannot talk about ""The House of Black and White"" without mentioning the thematically, orchestrally and atmospherically multi-layered music scoring and the unforgettable main theme.

It always has a natural flow, is layered and thought-provoking and demonstrates a wide range of emotions. The story is still riveting, with plenty of passion and sensitivity.Summing up, the season has not quite settled yet but there is more than enough to make one convinced to keep watching. 9/10 Bethany Cox"
527,41,9,1,"The House of Black and White is another great episode in the fifth Game of Thrones season.Yes, the pacing did drag a bit longer, but what it fails in pacing it makes up for it by advancing the plot progression a bit nice. The performances are still great, the storyline/script continue to be well-written, the directing and editing is well-focused, the scenery is still gorgeous to look at, the sets and costumes are still lavish, the music score from Ramin Djawadi is still beautiful, and the relationships continue to shine. So, overall, another great episode in the fifth season. :)"
528,41,9,1,"The episode starts where it last left. Arya is angry at the Black and White (CGI) building in pursuit of . Confused Snow, Conspicuous Unsullied mark this episode. In the previous episode we see Daenerys/ Mhysa (now) is confused and is afraid she is not able to control her dragons. Her woes continue. Extrapolating to her rule, it's tentative as well. She is weaker than ever and is confused on what to do. We get to see a bit of the water gardens.What bothers me is they give very less screen time to the poor Arya Stark. Despite that fact this is a good episode. Something heavy is up for Cersei and Tyrion. An exciting episode 3 is on it's way.Overall Rating - 8.5/10"
530,41,10,1,Another exciting episode with lots of action and a great story
514,40,8,1,"I couldn't care less if the Series is diverging from the Literature: the books are not canonical texts (neither I would bother if they were); I couldn't care less about disputing which one is the chosen one: the source will always be the ""best"" because it was the first and it's the basis for the inspiration... well, that's subjective, but hey... I couldn't care less! We readers and viewers have to understand that one thing is a book, another thing is an audiovisual work. Both have merits on their own and both use different languages to speak for themselves. What comes first comes first, but I couldn't care less. After all the author is blessing the series, even directing some episodes, and he is all smiles about its route, so... why whining? What matters for me is quality, its juice - narrative with excellence. A story with layers and layers of reviving itself from the ashes, the mighty test of enduring when being hammered in flames, the plausibility of a character's metamorphosis (our own in life), the prevailing string of a persona's charisma: Shakespearean political plots vs. Humanism.That's what you will find in this episode. Forget about hysterical plot turmoils, Hollywood agendas and frantic compasses. You'll only find a solid narrative with delightful clues for the ""Wars to Come"". When you reaffirm the protocols of seeing good old ""Game of Thrones"" again and for the 5th time the episode has already finished leaving you with a watery eye. Son of a...!"
512,40,9,1,"This story starts from where it left, Tyrion coming out of the Wooden box, Cersei and Jamie feeling differently about Tyrion and their father's death. Everything expected happens to Mance Rayder, as John plays a sitting duck in settling the truce. I don't seem to fancy Khaleesi and the charmer Daario Naharis' relationship. It only weaken's the Dragons' Mother's charismatic character. (Probably that's the writers' intent).'Littlefinger' Baelish and Lord Varys get a little more important in this one.Overall it's a great episode, the next one should be about Arya Stark.My Rating - 9/10 -------------------------------Game of thrones directors have unique way of filming and showing the content. They film episodes in tandem and in parallel, showing say 3 stories in one episode and another 3 stories in next episode. This makes the show riveting and fresh and very new scene is about another character. ------------------"
510,39,10,1,"There's so much to say about this episode, I don't know where to begin. It's just ... Well, just watch it!"
509,39,10,1,"Season 4, episode 10. Jon Snow goes to the Wildlings to negotiate terms. Stannis and his army invade the Wildling's camp. Cersei refuses to marry Loras Tyrell but her father, Tywin, keeps insisting that she has to marry him. Brienne and Pot run into The Hound and Arya - Brienne and the Hound fight, Arya is now alone and sets sail for Braavos. Bran and party reaches the three-eyed raven. Jaime sets Tyrion free to go with Varys to the Free Cities but first Tyrion roams the castle, finds Shae in the bed of his father Tywin -- Tyrion confronts Tywin.10/10"
493,38,10,1,"this is the best episode in the entire series, the battle of castle black was REALLY badass, it was brutal, insane, gory, and adrenaline fueled, and it's the most action filled scene in the series and one of the most exciting battle scenes I've ever watched, it's just 30 minutes of pure carnage and it filled up the whole episode after the preporation for it. season 4 has been the most badass season of the whole show, it's just been total insanity and all out chaos lol, I'm definitely gonna buy season 4 when it comes to DVD, I was on the edge of my seat and inhaling and exhaling in excitement the whole time lol, I give the watchers on the wall an 11 out of 10. here's my favorite episodes in order1. the watchers on the wall 2. the rains of castamere 3. blackwater"
494,38,10,1,If an episode like this is not rated 20/10 then its not overrated.
495,38,10,1,I couldn't watch this episode with countless thrilling and goosebumps. What a great action and incredible scenes.
496,38,9,1,"The Night's Watch men are ready to defend Castle Black against the Wildlings. Gilly arrives with her baby and Sam hides them in a food store. Jon is assigned to protect the Wall by Ser Allister and he goes down to protect the gate. The battle begins with giants and one mammoth trying to open the outer gate. Meanwhile Ygritte and Tormund fight inside Castle Black. Will Castle Black and the Wall fall to the Wildlings attack?""The Watchers on the Wall"" is an episode that takes place in Castle Black and on the Wall only. The battle is very well developed from the initial tension of the watchers to their resistance against the Wildlings. It is good to see Ser Allister recognizing his error for not protecting the gates the way Jon Snow had suggested. The fights are brutal, with great choreography and make-up. Jon Snow's bold decision of meeting Lance might be the last chance of the Night's Watch. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): ""The Watchers on the Wall"""
497,38,10,1,"Unfortunately sandwiched between two of the most highly praised episodes of the series, Watchers on the Wall is my favorite of the whole series. It's action packed and it's visually extraordinary, but what I love most about it is the acting and the great payoff that's been set up for the past couple of seasons. Each big death is pretty heartbreaking, no matter how important each character is. My least favorite part about the whole thing is Sam's subplot but even that is pretty great. It does a lot to evolve his character and it's good to see him get a break.I'm not like most of these people who drop 10 stars on every episode because I just don't think Game of Thrones is perfect. I love the hell out of it and it is one of my favorite shows but there's always something in an episode I don't really like (usually a Daenerys storyline), but all of the Jon/Nights Watch episodes are always great and this episode is a golden part of the series. What it does for the characters and overall storyline is done near perfectly and it's highly commendable from me."
498,38,10,1,"As the most expensive episode of the series, the Battle at Castle Black felt like an equivalent of The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers Battle of Helm's Deep."
499,38,9,1,"We have been ramping up to get to this battle. Unlike most episodes, this one pretty much focuses on a single event. That isn't to say that we aren't privy to all aspects of it. John Snow is in the middle of all this. The Wildings and Ygritte are at the forefront of the invasion, and a handful of the Watch face one another. Because of a strategic advantage, they are able to parry and thrust against the overwhelming army. Soon there is carnage everywhere, but the Watch has incredible motivation. The fortress has never been conquered, but they must face the fact that a second foray would be devastating. It's hard for me to have much interest in the relationship between John and Ygritte because she is a cold blooded murderer. Even if one sees her people as victims, she doesn't hesitate to kill people who are just in the wrong place at the wrong time, even little children. This is a really well done episode because it gives us a great picture of the consequences of war. The one thing that I frequently have trouble with is identifying the two sides when they are engaged in battle. But, of course, we don't have uniforms to help us."
491,38,10,1,Epic... simply epic.After watching this episode I had to express myself somehow and writing a review no matter how brief is the best way to do it. This episode is simply astonishing in the way the fight scenes are filmed. At times it's like third dimensional and you feel part of the carnage displayed on screen. The scale at which the episode is filmed is of epic proportions; Peter Jackson would have been proud. There are some flaws but those flaws cant be avoided when filming fight scenes involving many men. It is really a character driven episode because somehow you get the feeling that you wont be seeing some of these characters alive again. All in all a great episode and I place in the top three of my favorite game of thrones episodes.
500,38,10,1,"This show has distinct battle and action heavy episodes each season and this is one of the shows most stylish and finest. Excellent one take kinda look to the battle - and terrific pulsing pounding score to keep the heart pounding. I later found out who the director was (if you haven't seen The Descent yet then you really should) and it totally makes sense why the tension is cranked so high in this episode. Great stuff and after seeing the ""Long Night"" in the last season - this is certainly a much superior battle."
502,38,10,1,"Came to 'Game of Thrones' fairly late in the game and due to being so busy the binge-watching was gradual.

It is though the season's most thrilling, if not as epic as ""Blackwater"" from Season 2. Basically, ""The Watchers on the Wall"" depicts the battle of the Night Watchers and the Wildings. It is a truly thrilling one, full of rousing heroism, intensity and some heart-break, 'The Lord of the Rings' comparisons have been thrown around and one can see why. It was the most expensive 'Game of Thrones' episode up to this point, and that is obvious in an episode that looks expensive and has more of a cinematic look than a good deal of films with a bigger budget. In terms of individual scenes, the major scene between Jon Snow and Ygritte which was heart-breaking. The very end makes one eager for the next episode. All the performances are great, but Kit Harrington, Rose Leslie and John Bradley are especially note-worthy in the major roles most focused on.Visually, ""The Watchers on the Wall"" looks amazing, as one would expect for 'Game of Thrones'.

It always has a natural flow, is layered and thought-provoking and demonstrates a wide range of emotions such as suspenseful tension, poignant pathos and witty humour. The story is paced beautifully, structured with such nuance and attention to coherence, a high emotional level and is done with intelligence, passion and sensitivity.Concluding, wonderful episode. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
503,39,10,1,"I don't like to compare shows that are entirely different, but G.O.T is like Breaking Bad was for me. The first season was great, but each of the following seasons (or novels) progressively gets better and better as the story goes on. This episode (and really the entire series) has perfect pacing in the way they present and tell their story.There were a few characters that were in quite dangerous predicaments last time we saw them. From what I saw last week and previous weeks, I didn't think a particular character was going to make a huge play this early, which was a nice surprise. I love how this show has such attention to detail with minor characters and (seemingly) minor side stories, very early on in the series. The show plants a seed here and then one there, I think nothing will come of it or maybe forget the person, place, old myth, past stories, history etc. , then boom, old stories and people appear, taking things in an unseen new direction. I kind of saw one or two things (generally) happening this episode, but two of the characters heavily featured in this episode really caught me off guard in the way they reacted to situations they were in. One character has been on a journey for quite a while, after seeing this episode I really feel he might find something another main character acquired in past seasons, very useful to him/her (and perhaps others) in the future. Like many G.O.T episodes, you will laugh, get angry, think wtf is going on, perhaps yell in joy at your TV, possibly at how bad a$$ a particular character is becoming; I believe I did most of these tonight.This episode was longer than normal, (66 minutes) but it felt like twenty minutes to me while I was watching it. This really set up Season 5 perfectly with tying some things up, making drastic changes to others and but shouldn't torture you with too many cliff hangers. This was a perfect finale, to the best season yet, but with how things went and appear to be going now, I can't see how season 5 won't be even better."
504,39,10,1,"All expectations met: Just brilliant! The presentation of season 4 was more than nice - it never could have been done better than this in any movies (trilogy or similar). The development of the new core characters is pictured in a very nice manner - the acting was more than fantastic - looking so forward for season 5 and beyond. I would wish the world of Ice and Fire would not end at all! The atmosphere in all circumstances was great. I just would wish we would have seen more details rather than going a little rushed through the book(s). Anyway hands down it was the most amazing season so far, very close to GRRM's Song of Ice and Fire. If you'd say Season 1-3 was good - season 4 will just amaze you - especially with ""The Children"" as its final. Keep up the good work HBO and the GOT team!"

It is also one of the best 'Games of Thrones' season finales, whereas a couple of the season finales have been cases of the penultimate episodes making more of an impression (Season 3 being especially notable in this regard) and one of the show's most thrilling, in drama and action, episodes. Action-wise, ""The Children"" rouses and excites in its intensity and its insane physical action dexterity, The Hound fight especially. ""The Children"" not just an action-packed episode. It is very much emotionally charged all the way through, with a lot of intimate character development, plot advancements, introduction of new ideas that one cannot wait to be developed and unexpected twists. Constantly, the acting cannot be faulted. It is not an exception with ""The Children"".

506,39,10,1,Not just the best season finale of GoT but one of the best finales in tv history.
507,39,10,1,"This episode filled with strong decisions, a few surprise & new storyline. Perfect for season finale."
508,39,10,1,"The Children does a great job tying up some loose ends left in the previous episodes and sets up the fifth season perfectly. There's nothing I have to fault this episode since I have so much to praise about it.The storyline/script continues to be well-written, the performances are great and makes the characters even more relatable including Tyrion, Sansa, and Arya who set off on separate paths to different directions to see what's in store for them. The directing and editing are smooth, the pacing, once again, never drags and the relationships continue to be interesting. The scenery, sets, and costumes are still fabulous and the music score from Ramin Djawadi continues to be beautiful.The scene where Arya leaves the Hound to die after he got wounded was nice since in the previous episodes, they started to bond with another, but it doesn't change the fact that they're different people since the Hound was a complete jerk to her and Arya wanted revenge on King Joffrey for what happened to her father. So, Arya heading off on her own was really cool.So, overall, another masterpiece of an episode and a great set-up for the fifth season. :)"
501,38,10,1,Another exciting episode with lots of action and a great story
589,47,10,1,"As you can tell by it's nearly perfect rating, Hardhome might just be the best episode in one of the best series ever created.I won't go into details but I can still remember how amazing and chilling it was the first time I saw it. It's a roller-coaster ride that ends in a calm, chilling, omniscient way that felt amazing."
653,54,10,1,"Hands down, ""the door"" is my favorite GoT episode. It is absolutely genius and has all the feels in it. Credit does go to George R. R. Martin for being a literary genius with one particular character (will not spoil), but how the directors portrayed George's concept in this episode was INCREDIBLE. Not to mention how mind blowing this episode was. Two thumbs up."

It was not perfect by any stretch, the Sand Snakes being a notable flaw and were the main drawback to the polarising but to me better than given credit for ""Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken"". There was also a lot to admire and love and personally liked to loved the previous episodes despite things taking a while to settle. While ""The Gift"" was the season's first truly outstanding episode, it is with ""Hardhome"" that sees 'Game of Thrones' in all its glory. ""Hardhome"" is not just the magnum opus of Season 5 even with two episodes left to go (the previous season magnum opuses being Season 1 with ""Baelor"", Season 2 with ""Blackwater"", Season 3 with ""The Rains of Castamere"" and Season 4 with ""The Laws of Gods of Men"" with a good case being made too for ""The Children""), but also one of the best episodes of the entire show.Plotlines and character development are advanced the most they were all season. There is a perfect balance of intricate character moments and drama, especially with Arya, the character of Karsi and showing signs of hope in increasingly dire straits. Similarly, there is a powerful mix of heart-wrenching poignancy, nail-biting intensity, shocking revelations and some of the show's most spectacular action that has emotional impact (exciting, terrifying and moving) and is more than just spectacle. The characters are all interesting and layered, and ""Hardhome"" boasts the sharpest script of Season 5, and one of the sharpest of the whole show, and the tightest pacing of all the fifth season episodes, anyone frustrated with the slow pace of the previous episodes (personally am not one of them) will be relieved.'Game of Thrones' always delivers on the acting. The casting is spot on and the performances are superb across the board, particularly from Peter Dinklage, Emilia Clarke, Maisie Williams and Birgitte Hjort Sorensen.Visually, ""Hardhome"" looks amazing, as one would expect for 'Game of Thrones'. The scenery is throughout spectacular, the sets are hugely atmospheric and beautiful on the eyes with a real meticulous eye for detail and the costumes suit the characters to a tee. The make-up is beautifully done. As well the cinematography and editing, which are cinematic quality as well.One cannot talk about ""Hardhome"" without mentioning the thematically, orchestrally and atmospherically multi-layered music scoring and the unforgettable main theme. Again, worthy of a high-budget fantasy/action/drama film.In conclusion, a fantastic episode that hits home hard. Anyone disappointed with the previous episodes, a lot were and again not one of them, will be thrilled with this. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
709,60,9,1,"HBO continues to be the home of fantasy and action combined with thought- provoking drama. GoT Season 7 premieres with all the depth of Season 6's finale. Without spoiling the fun, ""Dragonstone"" doesn't just pick up where ""Winds of Winter"" left off, it amps up the intensity and brings a promise of another great season of GoT.Most of our favorites get plenty of airtime, difficult considering the breadth of the series. As befitting a season premiere, we're given some surprising twists, reintroduced to some we've missed, and left ready for the next episode. In between, time flies... although the dragons wait a bit before appearing. But when they do appear, the title becomes both appropriate and poignant. The lack of deep dialogue provides a perfect background for the setting.Couple of tips - wait for that snack, make sure you watch from the start (before the credits) until the end. Pay attention to small talk and detail, and remember that we're off the books now... for the most part, DB and DW have the reins with GRRM providing oversight!Waiting for ""Stormborn""..."
710,60,10,1,"Just out of this world awesome, has to be the best season premier of any show ever. Every second of this one hour episode was pure gold, everything from the writing, to the amazing acting, directing and effects.HBO has done it again, this is the reason why Game of Thrones is the greatest show that has ever been. I have to also praise the score by Ramin Djawadi.All and all, this episode made it official, that Game of Thrones is way way better than the books it's based on. Sorry George, but sometimes adaptations are just better. And this is one of those times."
711,60,8,1,"This episode largely serves to remind viewers where each of the protagonists are and where they hope to go. In the opening scene we see that Arya's revenge against the Freys didn't end with the killing of Walder. Meanwhile her brother Brandon reaches The Wall, warning of the approaching threat while their siblings Jon and Sansa disagree on how to proceed after the defeat on Ramsey Bolton and his forces. Back in King's Landing Cersei, now the Queen, is seeking new allies for the coming fight against Daenerys's forces as well as against the Armies of the North and the Sand Sisters to the south. Elsewhere Sam is trying to find a source of dragon glass and Daenerys finally returns to Westeros.I really enjoyed this episode; it started well with Arya making it abundantly clear that she has lots of people to kill. It then proceeds to remind us what other characters are up to while setting things up for future episodes. The tension between Sansa and Jon hints at possible problems to come and the meeting between Cersei and Euron Greyjoy suggests the possibility of an interesting alliance. Apart from the opening scene there is little in the way of violence; even that involved poison rather than action; that didn't bother me though as the more talky elements served to remind me of the various characters after some time away from the series. I know some people weren't keen with having singer Ed Sheeran appear as a Lannister soldier but it didn't bother me; if I hadn't heard about his appearance before watching I doubt I'd have thought anything of it. As expected the cast are all on fine form and the effects are impressive. Overall a long season opener that immediately brought me back into the story after a gap of almost two years."
712,60,9,1,"After being impressed by how impressive the sixth season of Game of Thrones was when it continued the character arcs for the surviving Stark and Lannister family members and the writing was as strong as the previous five seasons (despite one episode in season 5 that I considered to be my least favorite, Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken even though it was decent). Anyway, when I saw the first episode of the seventh season last summer in order to catch up with the series finale coming in 2019, it lived up to my expectations and it became a great start. The reason why I'm giving this a 9/10 is because the only quibble that I have with Dragonstone is that while it was great to see Ed Sheeran and the other song artists Will Champion, the drummer from Coldplay and Gary Lightbody from Snow Patrol playing Lannister soldiers and sharing a scene with Maisie Williams, they only appeared for four minutes. I mean, after they sang that song together, I was expecting them to have more screen time in the seventh season, but sadly, they didn't. What a shame.Anyway, the rest of the episode is solid. The storyline continues to be exquisite much like the previous six seasons and continues to up the ante with the relationships. Not only that, there are some great scenes that made it worthwhile to other viewers. Arya disguising herself as Walder Frey and having her revenge on the House of Frey for killing her mother Catelyn Stark and her brother Robb Stark by killing them, Sandor Clegane, who survived his wounds after the fourth and sixth seasons and having to atone for his old life of working with the House of Lannister, and Daenerys's dramatic homecoming to Dragonstone. Those sequences are amazing and another perfect example of well-paced and atmospheric filming which makes them on par with The Red Wedding, the Execution of Eddard Stark, the destruction of the Great Sept, and more. Ramin Djawadi continues to create more excellent music for his score for this season. It fitted the scenes really well as well as retaining the scale and scope of the production designs, which are still as gorgeous and before. The editing is sharp, the pacing didn't drag, and the acting continues to be strong with the best coming from Maisie Williams, Kit Harrington, Sophie Turner, and Emilia Clarke.Overall, Dragonstone delivered what it promised. It showed the characters trying to make an army to they can begin the war against the White Walkers while continuing the depth and development. This deserves a thumbs up from me. :)"
714,60,9,1,"Game of Thrones is finally on its seventh season now. And we finally have the endgame in sight for the story. This episode does admittedly fall short of the previous two OUTSTANDING episodes from season six, but we still want to see where Daenerys, Tyrion, Jon Snow and The Hound end up by the time the story is all wrapped-up come season eight.This was a good episode to start on, but I'm mighty curious to see where this will all go to. Will Tyrion survive? Will Daenerys actually take back her long-lost home of Kings Landing? And will The Hound confront his brother The Mountain? I hope the latter happens; that will be a fight to remember.Anyway, Game of Thrones is still on the air and still leaving an impact on us."
715,60,9,1,"Season 7, episode 1. The Hound and Beric Dondarrion are aligned - both wonder why they are still alive, Beric talks Hound into looking into the fire to see what he can see. Cersei is trying to find allies - Jaime is there to help her. Arya pays a visit to all the Freys to remind them ""The North Remembers"". Daenerys, Tyrion and their fleet arrive in Westeros. Sam and Gilly are adapting to their new life in Oldtown - Sam discovers a Stannis must have been correct. The Night King is making his way south. 9/10"
716,60,10,1,"This is how 1st episode of new season of a series should start .It is without drag ,it didn't divert from the plot and no unnecessary scenes in this episode.Perfect start for a new season of Game of Thrones and this is what viewers and a Game of thrones fan would expect, a perfect start ."
718,61,10,1,Don't let the bad reviews fool you. 95% of those are coming from salty book purists or fanboys of other shows that are crying because their favorite show will never even come close to the very scale and magnitude of Game of Thrones. The episode was great from start to finish. People complaining about wooden dialogue are again just the salty book purists who have a stick so far up their a** that it literally comes out of their mouth when they talk. These first two episodes have had amazing build up and I cannot wait to see what comes next.
720,61,9,1,"In Essos Daenerys has largely been running her own show. In Westeros she need allies, and an interesting power struggle is now breaking out around her. How should she go about conquering Westeros? ""Be a dragon"", Lady Oleanna advices. But can you actually be a benevolent dragon?"
721,61,9,1,"At Dragonstone, Daenerys, Tyrion and Varys discuss a strategy to take Westeros without burning the Seven Kingoms to ashes with their allied Melisandre, Yara Greyjoy, Eliaria and Lady Olenna Tyrell. Tyrion proposes an alliance with Jon Snow to Daenerys and she sends an invitation to him to visit her. In Kings Landing, Cersei tries to gather allied to fight Daenerys and Qyburn shows a powerful weapon to kill dragons he has developed. Meanwhile Jon Snow decides to accept the invitation of Daenerys expecting to convince her to use her dragons and the dragon glass in her land to destroy the White Walkers. Arya learns that Jon Snow is the King of the North and decides to return to Winterfells and has an unexpected encounter. Samwell tries to secretly heal Jorah from the greyscale risking his career. Yara Greyjoy and Eliaria are navigating the Narrow Sea when they are surprisingly attacked by Euron and his fleet. ""Stormborn"" is a great episode of ""Game of Thrones"" with good segments and surprising conclusion. Now the strategies are discussed by the opponents with their allied and the war is close. Most of the characters have great participation and the viewers will certainly anxiously looking forward to see the sequel. My vote is nine.Title (Brail): ""Stormborn"""
724,62,10,1,"WOW !! This episode was cleverly done. It was by far the best episode of this season, i'm speechless ..The Queen's Justice has given us such a satisfying moments, it brought us forward in the story even faster than we thought possible., it was enjoyable, the storytelling is getting better than ever, beautifully written episode and thanks to D§D. And i'm sure the best is yet to come .."
725,62,9,1,"Came to 'Game of Thrones' fairly late in the game and due to being so busy the binge-watching was gradual. Have found myself truly loving the show, very quickly becoming one of my favourites. It totally lives up to the hype and not only does it do the brilliant source material justice (a rarity in television) it is on its own merits one of the finest, most addictive and consistently compelling shows in recent years and quality-wise it puts a lot of films in recent years to shame.While mostly liking ""Dragonstone"" and ""Stormborn"", the previous episodes of Season 7, they were of the ""starting the season promisingly and decently but not entirely satisfyingly"" kind. ""The Queen's Justice"" is quite a big improvement, and definitely one of Season 7's better episodes as can be seen by it being one of the best-received episodes of the season. It may not be 'Game of Thrones' at its very best or quite prime 'Game of Thrones', but it very nearly is.""The Queen's Justice"" starts off a little too slowly perhaps and Euron is still not particularly well written. It is well worth the watch however for a lot of things. The Jon and Daenerys scenes have a lot of passion and intensity, there is a lot of tension and emotion and the climactic scenes are just riveting and sees a great character go out in style. In an episode that largely is a perfect mix of intricate character writing and interaction and pointed action.It follows on from the previous two episodes setting things and putting it all into place, and expands on them and even more. Things are more eventful than before, more intricate, have more tension in the character relationships, characters and storylines show better progression, there's very little if at all padding and nothing really jars. All the acting is on point, with Diana Rigg in particular giving the season's first proper tour-De-force performance.Visually, it looks amazing, as one would expect for 'Game of Thrones'. The scenery is throughout spectacular, the sets are hugely atmospheric and beautiful on the eyes with a real meticulous eye for detail and the costumes suit the characters to a tee. The make-up is beautifully done. As well the cinematography and editing, which are cinematic quality as well.One cannot not mention the thematically, orchestrally and atmospherically multi-layered music scoring and the unforgettable main theme. Again, worthy of a high-budget fantasy/action/drama film.Layers, passion and sensitivity galore in the writing as well. The characters are very compellingly written and the interaction is handled intelligently. Most of the episode is very well paced and tight when it gets going. Overall, great. 9/10 Bethany Cox"
726,62,9,1,"SPOILER: Here we see Cersei and Daenerys handling power in very different ways.Cersei pursues vengeance, but sometimes against the wrong people. And is making promises she can't meet to the Iron Bank, and to Euron Greyjoy which she does not intend to keep.Is Euron Greyjoy really fooled? At the end, Olenna Tyrell lets Jamie know that Cersei was indeed wrong in blaming Tyrion for the death of Jofrey. A last act of malice, probably, since it will set him against Cersei. She caused much of the trouble including their father's death by her false accusation.Meantime Daenerys is losing because she tried to me merciful. And has sat in Dragonstone with her dragons, rather than going either to ferry the fleet from Dorn or help the Unsullied. Really no logic to it.On the positive side, she ends up being sensible about Jon Snow refusing to accept her as Queen of the North.We also get a repeat of the hint that the Red Priestesses know something Varys, who may have more secrets than he has revealed. One of them told him she knew what the demon said when he was a child. Now Melisandre tells him that both she and he are doomed to die in Westeros. And of course we don't know his story about his origins is true.She also speaks of the meeting of Jon and Daenerys as bringing ice and fire together. Has to mean something.Bran remains enigmatic, but presumably plans to tell Jon of his real parents. And does not trust Sansa with it. In fact he seems highly mistrustful of her."
727,62,10,1,"Latest seasons of GOT lacks smart tactics and brilliant dialogues and these are some of the things I really missed. This episode had it all, and it felt like an early season episode with R.R touch. From the acting to story to production everything was brilliant. This season raise the quality bar from the previous seasons."
729,62,9,1,"Jon Snow has sailed to see Daenerys at Dragonstone, against the advice of those close to him, and soon wonders if they were right. Daenerys makes it clear that she is the rightful Queen of the Seven Kingdoms and as such doesn't recognise his kingship of the north... still he must persuade her that it is vital that she helps him in the coming fight against the threat from north of the wall. Back in King's Landing Euron Greyjoy takes his niece, Yara; Ellaria Sand and her daughter Tyene to Cersei so she can have her revenge. Cersei has another visitor; this one from the Iron Bank; she promises that she will repay them soon. At Winterfell Sansa is reunited with Bran. Elsewhere The Unsullied attack Casterly Rock and Jaime's army attacks Olenna Tyrell's home, Highgarden.This was a really fine episode. It provided solid character development, advanced the plot and bid farewell to a favourite character. It was great to see two of the series' protagonists, Daenerys and Jon Snow finally meet; this was handled well with just the right degree of awkwardness; they may both be considered 'good guys' but that doesn't mean they should be friends or even trust each other as each has their own motives. Emilia Clarke and Kit Harington, as Daenerys and Jon, along with Peter Dinklage as Tyrion had impressive scenes together. Lena Headey stood out as we see just how cruel Cersei can be. In other scenes Sophie Turner impressed as Sansa Stark; a character that has improved as the series progressed. Finally Diana Rigg was great as Olenna; her scene with on form Nikolaj Coster-Waldau was top notch. If the episode had any flaws it was the shortness of the battle scenes... although this can be excused as they were meant to be easier than expected for the victors. Overall a really good episode."
708,60,10,1,"In Europe, the world premiere airs at 3am. And GoT is the only reason on this planet I'd set my alarm to wake me up in the middle of the night. Yes, it delivers. Yes it is epic. Yes with a start like this, one can only hold his breath for yet another week. Game of Thrones completely ruined the world of TV shows for me, because it raised the standards so high I'm having troubles finding another show to hook up with.Please, keep it coming and stay on this awesome course. It is an honor writing a review."
707,60,8,1,"Well, the longest wait in between seasons is finally over. Winter is here and Game of Thrones has returned. Much like most of the season premieres, 'Dragonstone' dealt with a lot of aftermath to last season's events, and a whole lot of set-up for this season. The one thing that separates this season from most is that it seems like the majority of the characters are actually beginning to realize the bigger threat at hand. That is, besides Cersei and Daenerys, they haven't gotten there just yet.Ironically, that's part of what really excites me about this season, though. The inevitable battle for Westeros and battle of wit between Daenerys and Cersei, and how everyone else deals with the army of the dead. Nearly half of the scenes mentioned the Night King or his army in some way shape or form. Of course, Cersei chooses not to associate herself with any of that, even going as far as mentioning every other threat in Westeros besides the white walkers. However, her scene with Jaime was just as interesting anyway. You can tell how torn and worried Jaime is. You can only hope the best for him, even after everything he's been through. And what might this gift be that Euron is offering to give Cersei? It's hard to think of anything she'd want more than Tyrion's head at this point, but I hardly believe that will be the outcome. Instead, I think it will be something or someone we haven't seen in quite some time. I tend to believe that Gendry Baratheon theory the more and more I think about it.In the North, we had a few important but predictable things happen. We had heard that there would still be some (unnecessary) tension between Sansa and Jon, well that was definitely the case. Isn't it about time Sansa trusts Jon's way of things? I get it, she's trying to warn Jon about being too honorable, something that got Robb and Ned killed. But there's something to be said for 2 family members on this show not arguing their way to an unpleasant death, am I right? Elsewhere at The Wall, Bran and Meera were let in after convincing Ed that he's the three-eyed raven and he knows everything. How long until Jon meets back up with Bran?Speaking of Starks, perhaps the person with the most memorable moments of the episode was Arya's 'Red Wedding Redemption' at Riverrun. I can't believe I'm saying this, but if it took spending 2 seasons at The House of Black and White for Arya to produce great scene after great scene, then I think it was all worth it. A reverse Red Wedding was exactly the cold open we needed, once again proving that George RR Martin can be good to the Starks after all. I was a little bit surprised to not see her immediately kill those Lannister soldier's, but I guess it was done to show us that there's still a little bit left of innocent Arya in her.There was a lot of Sam in this episode, perhaps too much. Check that, there was definitely too much screen time for Sam. It's not that I don't like his character, but I just don't see the reason behind wasting valuable time on something that could be sped by in a minute or two. He may have found the key to defeating the white walkers, and we found out Jorah isn't doing so well and spending time at the Citadel being partially taken care of by Sam himself. Cool to see Jorah, but man those scenes with Sam were crappy (for the most part). But, Seriously though.The last few bits included The Hound finding his way back to the house him and Arya stayed in a few seasons back, and Daenerys finding her way home. Both very different 'homecomings', but both very emotionally resonant scenes nonetheless. There isn't necessarily a parallel to be drawn between the two, but it's very interesting to think about how far those 2 characters in particular have come since the opening episode of the series. I love seeing The Hound in a different light, one that's less bloody and far more forgiving, and Daenerys is certainly at her most powerful after reaching her home. And that was about it for a first episode. Certainly an impressive opening, albeit not as surprising as last year's Melisandre shocker. It's annoying to think we only have 6 more weeks of this, but it will have to do for now. I'm 100% sure that the rest of the season will be top-quality Thrones.+Recap & set-up+Daenerys reaches home+Jaime is torn+Arya's redemption+The Hound's transformation-Sam cleaning up crap8.3/10"
706,59,10,1,"A review of this episode is incomplete without mentioning the musical score, it is perfect as it builds to a crescendo with the waiting, the fear, the arrogance, the anxiety and final realisation, it is the perfect match of audio visuals."
705,59,10,1,"This season is by far the best season in the history of television series. I never thought there would be a season like Breaking Bad S5, but boy I was wrong. GOT is the GOAT."
689,58,10,1,Not gonna say more but this episode deserve 10 on 10
690,58,10,1,"Wow.. just wow.. This is with out a doubt the greatest episode in the history of television. Not.. It's the greatest hour of any show/film ever. Every second of this hour long episode was gold. The writing, acting direction, scale and effects are just mind blowing good. This episode won the most amount of Emmys for an episode ever. And you can see why when watching this masterpiece. The main Battle sequence was the best battle I have seen on screen in my entire life. This is why this is the best show ever made. Their will never be another Game of Thrones. Never, never, never."
691,59,10,1,"You can ignore my 10/10, this episode goes far beyond IMDB's rating system.
If Battle of the Bastards is perfection we need a new name for Winds of Winter. It simply does not get any better than this. I don't use the word ""Flawless"" lightly but it's the only word that comes to my mind when thinking of this episode.
I showed this episode to my parents who generally hates the adventure/fantasy genre and it convinced them to give the show a a chance.
The visuals, the acting, the score and basically everything about this episode is impossible to resist regardless of your taste.
Television at it's absolute finest!"
692,59,10,1,"How can you write a review and not have any spoilers? I will attempt that. Game of Thrones doesn't disappoint and which each episode, you think you can't be surprised any further and you do. This episode was magnificently Shakespearean. It moves the story forward and it ends in an acceptable place. This thing played like an orchestra. Dare I say it..it has Godfather like quality to it. It is better than any movie I've seen in a long time and you will be very excited to talk about with your other GoT friends. And its so nice to see how each of these characters are so different from Season 1 Episode 1. Its just simply a brilliant show."
693,59,10,1,"They threw out everything I knew about last week's episode being a 10/10 and made their own rating system for this week's episode. How do you top the best episode of television of all time? Apparently with far and away the best television episode of all time. I expected the credits 20 minutes in and realized there was still almost an hour left.I was an early cynic/critic of this season and I feel that was was a justifiable opinion but that was the best movie of the year and it was a TV show. Hell they even made the sand snakes interesting again by infusing Olenna who is the absolute best when it comes to banter. Watching her crap all over them was the fan service everyone deserved. Everything was shot beautifully, everything was perfectly paced. Everything was everything."
694,59,10,1,"Simply Astonishig. The music is just perfect.
A perfect almost 25 minute start sequence like I have never seen in my life.Game of Thrones turns around once again."
695,59,10,1,"How do you top one of the best episode in the TV history??simple, By creating another episode with absolute perfection. DAMN Miguel Sapochnik is one hell of a director(Gift,Hardhome, BoB and now WoW), producers should use him to direct every episode of the coming seasons. WOW Just WOW what more can you say, this is how a season finale should be done, with perfection,clarity and little bit of anxiety for the next season. The episode started slowly , but it picked up on the way and it was great seeing every questions, stories are cleared and connected without losing the clarity. Acting was just top notch, Ser Davos was breathtaking, Lady Mormont damn she is one hell of a actress, the dialogues and the expression was superb and rest was below these guys.(not too down :P) The best thing was the BGM it was Hans Zimmer like, TAKE A BOW RAMIN DJAWADI, you were the soul of this episode without you it would not have the desired effect. It would take one hell of a episode to break the bar set by WoW (hoping for one). if you missed this, for any reason watch it at the earliest, because it is something that should not be missed :)"
730,62,9,1,"I certainly can say that I didn't enjoy last 2 episodes as much as I wanted, but holy this episode changed it, the storytelling, the justice, the turning tables, the look on Jaime's face, it was all in place to make this the best season 7 episode (for now), clearly an outstanding episode. I am very eager to see what is next for both queens, hopefully it won't disappoint"
696,59,10,1,"This was the best episode, if I dare say, of the entire show. From the piano/cello duet that is throughout, to every persons part of the story. So so good."
698,59,10,1,The first 25 minutes of this episode was some of the best directed and written television I have ever scene. Absolutely chilling.
699,59,10,1,"Just when you thought that the last episode ""Battle of the Bastards"" had all there is regarding those mind blowing twists, George R. R. Martin proved us all wrong. This episode has gotten me off my seat several times, and whenever I start to think that this is it and there will be no more surprises, I discover almost immediately that I could never be more wrong. This episode so far has a rating of 10/10 yet in my opinion it is still so frikin low. IMDb should implement a new rating system where we could give this show a 10000/10. I never really cared for writing a review before, but this show is just too much to keep to myself."
700,59,10,1,"Perfect writing, perfect direction, perfect acting
What an episode!!!!"
701,59,10,1,"For the longest time (close to 6 years), I managed to never watched one full episode of GoT. Everyone was always talking about it, but I knew I had to watch from season 1 episode 1 to give it any justice and I just never found time to watch all episodes from the beginning. And then that week happened.It was the week when HBO showed Season 6 Episode 10: Winds of Winter. I was channel surfing and coincidentally was on HBO on that very moment when the episode was starting. The intro music of GoT always sounded so interesting to me and this time I decided to watch the episode despite knowing almost zero about GoT.and I was awestruck. floored.It was breathtakingly beautiful and dramatic, and get this, I knew almost nothing about the characters.I was hooked. I was intrigued.And so the next week when I had so much free time, I binge watched all episodes from Season 1 episode 1 all the way to Winds of Winter.This doesn't even describe how hooked I was and how powerful is WoW to be able to force me to finally watch the whole show, something that I have postponed for almost 6 years. WoW is the single greatest episode in all of TV shows history. Not joking."
702,59,10,1,"Phenomenal acting, directing, unforgettable emotional scenes make this episode the best episode in television history!"
703,59,10,1,"As long as you've been keeping track of this show since season 4 or 5, you will agree this is the best episode ever."
704,59,10,1,"What a great journey this season has been. This is now turning into one of the greatest shows of all time, which after just the first two or three seasons, was hard for me to predict.I have not cast my vote on this show yet, i wait until it is done. Only then, i feel i can vote on this series. Where many TV series deliver a good or strong first season and receive a high vote, just to plummet later, and still keep their high scores. I just feel that on a TV show, the entire story needs to be told before i can finally deliver my own verdict.Because as i mentioned, many TV shows becomes increasingly worse over time, even TV shows with only a few seasons often do. But this is not the case with ""game of thrones"". This show has definitely had it's ups and downs, but what it does well is to keep on delivering strong scripts, strong performances, strong direction, strong CGI. Well it's strong in everything basically.I personally never thought this series could deliver drama to the level of ""The Wire"" or ""The Sopranos"" just to mention two. But however i always thought it would deliver a strong story that would intrigue and keep people on the edge of their seats, which it has done with flying colors, almost at the level of ""Breaking Bad"".When i saw the red wedding episode, i felt the same way do now. I have this sensation of WOW flowing through me. I have just witnessed something extraordinary. And then i feel like praising the people, the cast, the entire production for their outstanding craftsmanship. I'm simply in awe of this episode i just watched.The episode before this, ""The battle of the bastards"". Was a bit of a disappointment to me. I felt it was way to predictable and that to much happened in that episode alone to make me feel satisfied by the outcome. The episode was by no means bad, but i have come to set the bar pretty high when it comes to TV shows like this, and when i feel disappointed, the episode might still be a 8/10.But this episode however is one of the best episodes made in any TV show, of all time. I mean it. This is a masterpiece of an episode which manages to do everything right, i am absolutely blown away of what i just witnessed. And now i can't wait for the next season to begin, i better start eating my vitamins, i don't want to risk passing away before next spring. Come to think of it i should maybe stay inside and avoid using ladders and such as well.There is not much more to be said. There is no reason to say anything else. The episode simply is a 10/10 without any doubt. And not to jinx anything, but if the shows keeps this up, it will be a 10/10 as a whole as well. And that is seriously something i never expected.Now i need to go to the gym and start lowering my blood pressure."
697,59,10,1,"Even though there is no fights and action scenes in this episode but it is indeed as good as The battle of The Bastards episode. firs of all : the music... God! the music is good probably the best thing in the episode it will get you hooked from the first second. The events unexpected and perfect and very well done and brings moments we've all been waiting for and we find out about either the most famous theory is right or not. The acting is great as usual. and what really makes this episode great that it's full of important events and prepares for a great next season and it closes a good season in a great way. Finally, this is how drama should be made. great drama with great dialogues and acting."
731,62,9,1,"Sometimes we have to help others even if we don't want to. I got an introduction to this kind of help. A remarkable one immediately got some awesome introductions. In this episode, on the one hand, some new relationships came up, while on the other hand, some wrong decisions changed a lot. If you want to burn and ruin someone else's family, then some of your hands will also burn, this is exactly the identity I got behind this incident. If a person from his own family, who was lost a long time ago, suddenly returns, he feels a strange happiness, but with him many questions arise in his mind, the answers to those questions will be found in this episode. An introduction to how an entire dynasty ended little by little can be found in the episode. This episode is really good and thrilling compared to the first episode."
732,62,9,1,The great game has begun. this episode did really good job. set-up for the long night & continue the game of thrones. brilliant dialogues & music.
733,62,9,1,"There's plenty of drama in this episode, but the highlight is still something as simple as two characters finally meeting each other. And I can't shake off the feeling that we're witnessing two worlds collide."
774,67,10,1,"I had the honour of attending the first episode of the last season in Belfast. What an experience! You can clearly see that HBO has done everything in their power to make the season feel as grotesque as possible. The episode has everything a good Game of Thrones episode should contain: tension, shock, surprises, nudity and emotional moments. The episode is filled with beautiful and surprising reunions and feels much more cinematic. The pacing is fine and the fifty minutes feel like five minutes in the end. For me personally, this is the best season opener, closely followed by ""Two Swords"" and ""The North Remembers"". The episode also has an unexpected end, something to look forward to."
783,68,9,1,Definitely the last good episode on the show. It's almost heartbreaking really.
784,68,8,1,A knight of the seven kingdoms is not as half bad as other episode!! Don't drag it down with the others. Give some respect to the producers and writers of this episode please
785,68,10,1,Just an incredible penultimate episode. Every character had a moment. So much rich & incredible interaction. This is goodbye to a lot of characters tonight. It's devastating. Next weekend will be like a funeral. Im terrified. And not ready. Be careful what you wish for when you want non stop action. Ep 3 will be just that and everything you've loved about this show will turn to ash in your mouth. You'll want to come back to this episode after it all just to see their faces.
786,68,10,1,"I'm sorry but clearly some people on here have never properly watched the show or have just recently binged it all and just skipped past the ""boring"" talking bits?! Seriously GOTs has always been character driven, that's why when the big moments happen you feel so emotionally involved! Next weeks Episode 3 is a 1hour 22 minute battle sequence that has been set up perfectly by the first 2 episodes. Those of you leaving 1 star reviews need to get a grip and have a serious reality check! I'm not saying everyone should give this episode a 9 or 10 but anything below a 7 is madness. If you just want mindless action and fighting with no character driven storylines go and watch a Transformers movie!"
787,68,10,1,"To everyone saying that this episode is a boring filler episode, you need to understand that it is a lot of characters' final moments on the show. If you wanted the show to rush to the action and forget about any touching character moments then you're watching the wrong show. Every character had a different way of coping with the inevitable which made the episode brilliant and doesn't give away any clues on what characters will survive the battle. When game of thrones is over, this will be the saddest episode to look back on as we'll realise that it's the last time we'll see certain characters' traits and interactions with each other. 10/10Edit: Easily the best episode of the season."
788,68,10,1,"Boy did this deliver. I liked the premiere 'Winterfell', but this is on an entirely different level. I laughed, I got chills, I cried. I won't spoil anything, but the writing in this is incredible. Even though I love Game of Thrones (also the later seasons), I never thought I'd say that about a season 8 episode. Sure, the writing last episode was good, but this is seriously season 3 - 4 levels of writing. Beats 'Kissed by Fire' as my favorite build-up episode. I think that when all is said and done and people rewatch the entire show, this will be one of the best episodes. It just flows so well and perfectly prepares us for the biggest battle we're ever going to see. I'm gonna miss Game of Thrones so much, let's enjoy it while it lasts."
767,66,10,1,"In King's Landing, Daenerys, Jon Snow and Cersei have a tense meeting where they show a wight to Cersei that does not accept the proposed armistice. However, Tyrion has a private encounter with her and she changes her position. At Winterfell, Sansa brings Arya to accomplish a death penalty for murder and treason. Then Samwell has a meeting with Bran and they discuss Jon Snow's lineage. At Eastwatch, the Night King riding his dragon and the White Walker army attack the Wall. ""The Dragon and he Wolf"" is another excellent episode of the Seventh Season of ""Game of Thrones"". The only remark is the discussion of on Jon Snow's lineage that deserved to be longer and better explained. But every segment is great and shows surprises, like Cersei and Sansa's decisions. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): ""The Dragon and the Wolf"""
789,68,10,1,Anyone who has been watching this show for a decade knows the value of this episode. We never had an episode like this where almost the whole cast was in a single scene! This episode was really for the true fans of got who have been wishing to see how all these actors can come together and interact with each other. This episode was and emotional roller coaster where u laugh in one scene and cry in the next one! I loved it to the core!
791,68,10,1,"This is an intelligent episode. Brilliant writing, directing, acting, cinematography. The main theme is memory. What and when to forgive, and what to remember. ""Never forget who you are!"" All characters remember who they were, and what they've become, before death arrives. It is also a farewell episode. We will lose them all this season. ""We never want them to leave"" but they all will. Valar Morgulis! But we will remember ! Fans will remember!"
792,68,9,1,"This episode was amazing at setting the tone for the upcoming battle, tying off loose ends, and starting a final storylines."
793,68,10,1,Rarely do we get to spend so much time with the characters before a large battle. And in this episode we got to visit with each of them and gain some understanding into who they are. We got some powerfully quiet scenes to remember why we cared for them and to feel the distress of the battle more intensely.
794,68,10,1,"This was the only episode that matches the sheer quality of past seasons. It had good dialogues and scripts, and set the stage for the coming battle flawlessly. I was so excited and hyped and I had no doubt that this season is also going to be epic.
But Alas!!! That was not the case."
795,68,10,1,"Those on here bemoaning 'filler' episodes either joined the party too late or aren't fans. Full to the brim with moments that I've waited 10 years for. The action will come and it will be incredible, but episodes like this are what GoTs is all about. I love these characters, I've spent ten years watching them. It's right that we get to say goodbye to them first."
796,68,8,1,"""A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms"" is an important episode, with reconciliations of old enemies; realization of Brienne of Tarth, now a knight of the Seven Kingdoms and Arya Stark, now a woman; and discovery of Jon Snow that now knows who he is. The episode is also a preparation for the next one that may be the best episode of the whole series and certainly the farewell of several characters. Looking forward to become true. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms"""
797,68,10,1,A really great episode showing lots of emotions between the characters
790,68,10,1,"At first, we all expected for an episode like the first one of the season, with all the preparations for the great battle. But they give us an unexpected rush of feelings. As the dead march to Winterfell, we get a unique chance to see every main character with an open heart to express their feelings, their regrets, redemption, fears and hopes. I don't know if we are aware of how hard it's to reach that and transmit it to the audience in such a magnificent way. This goes beyond fights and sex, we got one last time to share with the persons we have been following for nearly ten years, in what it might be their last moments on screen. I'm sure this experience will be geting more credit after the Battle of Winterfell, and the show ending. For me, it's enough to say that we are beholding one of the masterpieces of the greatest show ever aired."
688,58,10,1,I don't know why this episode didn't reached to 10/10 that's unfair
766,66,10,1,"It happens often that you stumble upon a great movie or great series, but I've never watched something with more interest, with more attention and with more passion than this show, and especially this episode right here. From astonishing dragon sequences to beautiful love scenes, from revelation to elimination, from pride to wisdom, from scenery to camera work and from scoring to superb acting, this episode has it all.This episode alone should keep us warm for the next year and a half."
762,66,10,1,"After finishing its seventh season, I've reached the point where I'd name ""Game of Thrones"" as the best fantasy I've ever read or seen. It's also among the best television I've ever seen, period. I'd cheerfully rate this penultimate season a perfect 10.I do understand some of the criticisms I've read from other fans. Yes, this shorter, more eventful, seven-episode arc could seem a little rushed when compared with prior seasons. And certain plot points in the last several episodes here are easy to nitpick.But I can't give less than a perfect rating to a show that I enjoyed this much. Season 7 added great action and special effects, lots of momentum, frightening horror, and some long-awaited conclusions to story arcs that began back in Season 1. And the show still has the best dialogue of any current television show that I'm aware of, usually supported by terrific acting.I won't say more for fear of spoilers. But I obviously loved this season."
735,62,9,1,"Jon Snow and Sir Davos travel to Dragonstone to meet Daenerys. Jon asks for help to Daenerys to fight the White Walkers but in the position of the King of the North and not a minion. Daenerys ""invites"" Jon and Davos to stay in her house but the diplomatic Tyrion wisely advises Daenerys to give dragon glass to Jon to show good faith to him. Meanwhile Euron brings Ellaria Sand and her daughter Tyene and gives them to Cercei that revenges Myrcella's death. Sansa is worried with the supplies for the coming war and surprisingly meets her brother Bran at Winterfell. Grey Worm and the unsullied army attack Casterly Rock and have a surprise. Samwell heals Jorah at the Cidatel.""The Queen's Justice"" is so far the best episode of the Seventh Season of Game of Thrones. The dialogues are sharp and witty with great participation of Daenerys, Jon Snow, Tyrion and Cercei. The different tactics adopted by the Machievellian Cercei and Daenerys to win the war are impressive. The subplots are also very interesting. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): ""The Queen's Justice"""
736,63,10,1,"Easily just as great as the Battle of the Bastards and The Winds of Winter. Action packed from the beginning to the end. It will be hard for the following episodes to compare to this one. If they are remotely close or better, we are in full a ride for the rest of the season. Can't wait till the next episode, to see how this is going to play out. The spoils of war is only 50 minutes, what are the hour + episodes are going to bring? 10/10 easily"
737,63,10,1,"A tremendous episode! It features a rather interesting and rather intimate moment between Jon and Daenerys. An unexpected and quite entertaining action sequence also occurs between Arya and Brienne. And Jon Snow encounters still another familiar face.But this episode will mostly be remembered for the simply amazing battle at the end.The spectacular and horrific battle sequence had me on the edge of my seat. Never have so many of our favorite characters been placed in so much peril-- including the dragon. The epic battle scene was both astonishingly beautiful and shocking as soldiers on both sides fall victim to the cruelty of war from the ground and from the air.Ironically, in an earlier conversation, Bronn discusses the myth of the 'glory' of war. Unfortunately,his point is suddenly illustrated when he and Jaime suddenly find themselves enveloped in an absolutely terrifying battle which will probably psychologically scar these characters for life-- if they survive:-)"
738,63,10,1,"I knew Game of Thrones was good, and I slowly became a fan recently, but I was reserved in how much of a fan I was...until tonight. I now officially love the show. Anyone who has not seen it yet and who are only watching shows like the Walking Dead are missing out. This is the Walking Dead on steroids and much much better. It's a great show. This is the moment so many have waited for for years. Let's hope they can keep them coming like this."
739,63,10,1,One of the finest episodes of GOT. This episode just raised the expectation. Previous 3 episodes keep cersei ahead but mother of dragon took one episode to make it equal or go ahead. This episode surely a good execution of story line. Let's see what happens to the next episode. Expecting more from episode 5.
740,63,10,1,You get to episodes like this.GoT keeping up with expectations at full.
741,63,10,1,"Well, this episode goes right at the top of the list for this season and among the top ones across all seasons.The winter fell sequence is so emotionally satisfying and you would definitely be touched by the scenes there.Well, coming to the title - 'Spoils of War', this war sequence is treat for your eyes. No words are enough to thank the writers, producers and directors of this show who bring us such magnanimous display on the TV. All I can say is when the war sequence ended, my heart was pumping hard and my body was shivering. You got to see it to feel it!"
764,66,10,1,"NO NO NO !!! Please someone tell me this is not the end. What was that? How can i describe this episode? From where do i start? Can i say it was perfect? No, because even the word perfect doesn't do justice for this unbelievable episode. That was really HUGE. THIS is how you end a season. This is how a season finale should be done. For me, The Dragon and the Wolf is the best episode to date, HANDS DOWN. Cinematic, unpredictable (for those who haven't read the leaked plot), incredibly thrilling, and it felt like an episode from the earlier seasons with a GRRM touch. It had everything we could have hoped for and more. it was packed with satisfying moments, emotional scenes, conclusions and managed to set up the finale season perfectly. Everything was incredible in every possible way.Ramin Djawadi, Thank you sir, as always you didn't disappoint us, the soundtrack made every scene more and more emotional.A special thanks to David Benioff and D.B Weiss for delivering us such an amazing and epic season. They did a spectacular job and we congratulate them for their success. BIG THANKS TO THEM <3So this is it. THE END, season 7 gave us everything we've ever wanted. Sadly, we have to wait until late 2018 for the series final season which it will only include 6 episodes, how painful. SUNDAYS WILL NEVER BE THE SAME AGAIN, Goodbye GoT .. You'll be missedAND NOW OUR WATCH BEGINS.10000/10."
742,63,10,1,"Game of Thrones remains a masterpiece, as always !!! Best Serie ever!!!"
744,63,10,1,"Jon Snow gets closer to Daenerys and shows his discovery in the dragon glass mine. Tyrion advises Daenery and she asks Jon to give his advice, and he tells that she must be a fair queen and not attack and burn the houses of the common people. Meanwhile Arya returns to Winterfell and reunites to Sansa and Bran. Jaime's army and Bron are looting House Tyrell and their lands when they have a surprise.""The Spoils of War"" is the episode that every fan of GOT was waiting for. The story is intense, all the segments are interesting and the battle scene is spectacular. One of the best of the whole series. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): ""The Spoils of War"""
745,63,10,1,"After the events of the previous episode the Lannisters have the funds to repay the Iron Bank; if Jaime can get it back to King's Landing. Arya arrives at Winterfell and is finally reunited with Sansa and Brandon. At Dragonstone John finds the dragon glass and once again asks Daenerys to help in the upcoming battle in the north; he also advises her not to attack the Red Keep... that doesn't mean she isn't going to attack the Lannister forces elsewhere.I've enjoyed season seven so far but this episode manages to take things to another level. It started well with the first half being dominated by the reunion of Arya and Sansa. These scenes were suitably handled; at first the guards try to deny Arya access to Winterfell; then when she tells Sansa about her list of people she intends to kill her sister is mildly amused... until she sees what an accomplished fighter Arya has become when she spars with Brienne. Maisie Williams, Sophie Turner and Gwendoline Christie are great in these scenes. As good as that was there was better to come as Jaime and the Lannister army are attacked by the Dothraki horde and Daenerys, who is riding a dragon. This was one of the best battle sequences to date; it started gradually as first a gentle rumble was heard; it quickly built to a crescendo as battle commences and Daenerys's dragon burnt dozens of opposing soldiers when close combat lead to the sort of mayhem one would expect... it had the intensity one would expect from a big budget Hollywood movie rather than a mid-season TV episode. I have no idea how the series will follow up this episode but look forward to finding out."
746,64,8,1,"Tyrion has seen so much of evil. He was detested by his own family at his birth. When one looks at the simple disrespect for life, it's interesting he wasn't stabbed in his crib. This has led to him being a truly moral character, having had to overcome so much, including the betrayal by his own sister. Tyrion believes in some sort of peaceful settlement. The big war is coming and Cersei hasn't got all that much of an army and must depend on alliances (she has lots of gold). It is decided by Dany and Jon Snow that capturing one of the wights and bringing him to Cersei would seal the deal. Why is this so? So off go our heroes to capture one of these guys, amidst the hordes of the undead (they seem to come back even when you break them into pieces). I fail to see any of the logic in this, other than to set up a battle with these guys. We also have Sansa and Arya at odds. Arya thinks Sansa has taken the easy road, playing up to whomever she can manipulate. Arya, of course, has become the consummate warrior. This is Ana intriguing episode, but it doesn't lack a good deal of common sense and some sort of precious moments."
749,64,9,1,"East Watch was all about building up of many many plots, all of which were superbly done with amazing story telling.Many reunions took place, well I won't mention which ones to avoid spoilers but all of them were so superb that I can't wait to see how they all turn up.Little Finger is doing what he is best at, but this time I just wish that Starks change their legacy.Danaerys showing both sides of her again in this episode, soft and hard, which shows that she can be a different ruler than what westeros has seen in the past. The scenes between Danaerys and Jon are somehow getting soft and romantic.A glimpse of Old cunning Cersie was back which was good to watch as her scenes weren't as strong in the previous episodes as they used to be.You might not like this episode if you always want an action packed episode like the Spoils of War, but let me assure you guys the plots built up in this episode are exactly like the silence before the storm and something special, very special is coming in next week's episode. Can't wait for that.9/10"
751,64,10,1,"WOOOOOOW.. From where can i start? HOLLY S*** !! Eastwatch is by far the best episode in season 7, a MASTERPIECE, it even surpasses The Spoils Of War, i did not see that coming to be honest. The episode contained huge revelations, many reunions and amazing set of events, it was beautifully written by d§d , no we can admit that they finally found a way to tell the story in such a magnificent way. Eastwatch has set up everything perfectly for the next main episode. Brace yourselves folks, because episode 6 is going to be much bigger. Can't wait.9.7/10"
760,66,9,1,"Writing this before S8E6 aka the final episode.Season 7 had it's problems for sure, but if we only knew what will come upon us in S8 we would endlessly praise it for it's glorious writing.This is where the show should have ended, and it should be left for GRR Martin to finish his books before start filming again.
Character arcs were still untouched and we had high hopes for ending.Final season, the way it was written, completely destroyed the show."
761,66,8,1,"Season 7 was a letdown for me. I became accustomed to the unpredictability, which has disappeared the moment they ran out of source material. Now it feels more like a high budget Hollywood flick, where none of its major characters are in any real danger,where everything is fan fiction and where you get the feeling everything happens and is shot purely to make merchandise from it.(For example The fake tension at the frozen lake, where you get sad music, a shot of how defeated they are, followed with a faceshot of every character, so people would think they're in trouble, just to be saved a la deus ex machina- The way it was shot, I couldn't stop thinking of marvel's avengers)Overall I liked some of the reunions, it had some great visual effects and beautiful scenery, but as I said, the excitement is gone; it has become yet another predictable television show that doesn't dare to make major leaps.Negative: Tormund should have died in the 'true north', The Littlefinger plot was a real disappointment, The fasttraveling made me motion sick, The whole capturing a whight to convince Cersei was horrible. Some scenes were just there to mislead the audience (E.g. Arya and Sansa). I literally cringed during the last 2 episodesPositive:The Visuals and CGI was good. Performances by most of the actors (especially the Lannister cast) was on point as usual. There were some satisfying reunions and interactions.Overall it's worth watching, but don't expect it to be the same as previous seasons."
743,63,10,1,"This was the episode we have longed for this season and finally Game of Thrones has delivered. This show beautifully and perfectly captures battle scenes and the camera-work is really well done. We saw a showdown and collision of worlds we have waited long to see. The battle scene between Daenery's and the Dothraki vs the Lannister forces is arguably one of the best moments in this series. Seeing a dragon wipe out Lannister forces in Westoros was truly satisfying. Like many fans I watched the final moments in awe as I shuddered at who would die. This show has bluntly wiped out big characters in an instant. When we saw Jaimie go for Daenerys it looked like a major character would die but the show beautifully gave us a stalemate with both surviving. This episode got everything right from a great opening, dialogues, reunions at Winterfell to an epic battle. Jaimie's expression as he sunk into the Ocean was the same expression I had as I tried to fathom what just happened in the last 10 minutes.Thank you is what I want to say for a breathtaking episode. I can only wait in great anticipation for the next episode."
590,47,10,1,"Game of Thrones has become THE television fixation which people tend to really love or really hate. As for me, I reckon it's a medieval-European-influenced piece of fiction that's become a television tapestry of political commentary, genre-breaking television conventions, fantastic fight scenes and characters who have become household names comparable to the Star Wars and Harry Potter casts of characters: yet these guys have the intensity and evocation of tragic Shakespearean characters.Game of Thrones is blockbuster television done right, and Hardhome is one gigantic set-piece bursting with spectacle and character that has helped the show stay great."
687,58,10,1,"Like in Spinal Tap, I need the scale for this episode to go to 11. Spectacular! Satisfying."
685,58,10,1,"This episode is to the series what Goodbye Farewell, and Amen was to Mash, and Ozymandias to Breaking Bad...a classic series episode that prepares the viewer for what's next in the future. The battle scenes in this episode are the best ever made for television, and at a big cost. The locations where this show is filmed is very exotic, and the characters and dragons rule the show. The music is amazing as well as the pace of the show. If you have to see just one episode of GOT, this is the one."
620,51,10,1,"Came to 'Game of Thrones' fairly late in the game and due to being so busy the binge-watching was gradual. Have found myself truly loving the show, very quickly becoming one of my favourites. It totally lives up to the hype and not only does it do the brilliant source material justice (a rarity in television) it is on its own merits one of the finest, most addictive and consistently compelling shows in recent years and quality-wise it puts a lot of films in recent years to shame.Despite how my review summary sounds, actually still liked a lot but didn't love the Season 6 opener ""The Red Woman"", though some fans did not. Am of the opinion also of finding ""Home"" the superior episode, it was what ""The Red Woman"" should have been and felt more like for me like the season opener. It is one of the most positively received Season 6 episodes and have seen it often considered one of the best latter season episodes, both distinctions for very good reason. Here in ""Home"", characterisation and plot lines are both advanced (loved seeing more of Bran, after being neglected for a while, Ramsay being suitably despicable and am still really appreciating seeing Theon in a completely different light to when he was first introduced. There are plenty of shocks and leaving-one-floored revelations, with like ""The Red Woman"" necessary questions and predictions left on fans' lips being answered and with full impact. A lot happens in ""Home"", but it doesn't feel like there is too much going on or that it feels rushed. It is tautly paced but also takes its time without ever being too much of a slow burner. As one would expect, the cast can't be faulted with Iwan Rheon and Isaac Hampstead Wright here being the standouts. Peter Dinklage as always steals every scene he's in.Visually, ""Home"" looks amazing, as one would expect for 'Game of Thrones'. The scenery is throughout spectacular, the sets are hugely atmospheric and beautiful on the eyes with a real meticulous eye for detail and the costumes suit the characters to a tee. The make-up is beautifully done. As well the cinematography and editing, which are cinematic quality as well.One cannot talk about ""Home"" without mentioning the thematically, orchestrally and atmospherically multi-layered music scoring and the unforgettable main theme. Again, worthy of a high-budget fantasy/action/drama film.The writing is thought-provoking with plenty of passion and sensitivity. Summing up, outstanding episode and one of Season 6's best. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
621,51,10,1,"Despite the slow plot progression and little to do for the characters, the first episode was a good start to this season. However, this episode surprised me and since there's no problem I have, this is an improvement over The Red Woman.The story is a lot more compelling and advances the plot progression from the previous episodes perfectly. The performances are once again compelling with Lena Headey and Dean Charles Chapman sharing an emotional moment together. And that's not all. It finally revealed the fate of Jon Snow and left a shocking cliffhanger to what would really happen in the next episode.That being said, everything else turned out great. The pacing is tighter and never drags, the script is well-written, the directing is solid, Ramin Djawadi's music score shines and suits the emotional scenes and the atmospheric moments really well, and the editing is really good. So, overall, another classic episode for the entire show and an improvement over the first episode, which I thought was a good start. :)"
622,51,8,1,"Brandon is trained by Three-Eyed Raven and has visions of his childhood when he was happy and Hodor could speak. In Castle Black, Davos and his men is threatened by the Night's Watchmen but the Wildlings breaks in the Castle and the situation switches. Sersei is protected by the Mountain and Tommen does not allow her to go to Myrcella's funeral. However Jaime has a conversation with him and convinces Tommen to meet his mother. Then Jaime challenges the High Sparrow and finds how powerful he is. Tyrion decides to release two dragons that are not nourishing. Arya is being beaten again and is still blind. Ramsey learns that his father has a baby son and he takes a bloody attitude. Theon decides to leave Sansa that intends to go to Castle Black. The Greyjoys will have a heir in the Iron Islands. Davos makes an impossible request to Melisandre, but the witch is powerful. ""Home"" is a good episode of ""Game of Thrones"", with surprises in Castle Black. Jaime discovers how powerful the High Sparrow is. Ramsey's segment is the most violent and shows how despicable this character is. Arya's segment is boring and it finally seems that her situation will change with the presence of The Faceless Man. The conclusion again is the best moment of the show. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Home"""
623,52,9,1,"This was the best installment of the season thus far. Sublime character development backed up by top-notch performances, with elegantly paced directional progression of the story-line, along with a couple of intriguing plot points and adequate humor. Altogether a terrific hour of television, excellently built up for the colossal chaos and extravagant blood splatter we most certainly will be pummeled by. Or who knows, maybe there will be light. As long as the writers don't suddenly tread any ludicrous paths due to the absence of any source material, they are set to strike gold. And now the customary agonizing wait for the next episode begins."
625,52,9,1,"Came to 'Game of Thrones' fairly late in the game and due to being so busy the binge-watching was gradual. Have found myself truly loving the show, very quickly becoming one of my favourites. It totally lives up to the hype and not only does it do the brilliant source material justice (a rarity in television) it is on its own merits one of the finest, most addictive and consistently compelling shows in recent years and quality-wise it puts a lot of films in recent years to shame.It is always a Herculean task following on from such greatness seen previously. ""Oathbreaker"" had a tough task succeeding, and being just as good as, the previous episode ""Home"" considering how superb that episode was (one of the best Season 6 and latter season episodes). A tough task that it almost succeeds completely in, it's not quite perfect and it's not as special but it has a vast majority of what makes 'Game of Thrones' so great and signs that one shouldn't give up on the show. Tommen needs to develop a stronger personality and have more meat to his material before being considered as a love to hate character for me. Actually though there is hardly anything wrong with ""Oathbreaker"". It doesn't matter that it is not as action-packed as the previous two episodes (compared to ""The Red Woman"" actually that's a good thing), while not quite being a slow or quiet episode either. It also doesn't matter that it doesn't have as many reveals, shocks or cliff-hangers as ""Home"".What ""Oathbreaker"" does brilliantly in is putting things in place for what is to follow, without feeling like filler, forwarding story momentum and advancing character development and interplay. Daenerys and Arya are particularly well done in this regard and it was wonderful to see some development to Khaleesi. The highlight of the episode though is the Tower of Joy, totally exhilarating. Have nothing to fault the cast, who give uniformly never less than great performances. Iwan Rheon plays a true slimeball to perfection, now Ramsay is my definition of a love to hate character.Visually, ""Oathbreaker"" looks amazing, as one would expect for 'Game of Thrones'. The scenery is throughout spectacular, the sets are hugely atmospheric and beautiful on the eyes with a real meticulous eye for detail and the costumes suit the characters to a tee. The make-up is beautifully done. As well the cinematography and editing, which are cinematic quality as well.One cannot talk about ""Oathbreaker"" without mentioning the thematically, orchestrally and atmospherically multi-layered music scoring and the unforgettable main theme. Again, worthy of a high-budget fantasy/action/drama film.The writing is thought-provoking and very rich in layers with plenty of passion and sensitivity. Summing up, terrific. 9/10 Bethany Cox"
626,52,9,1,"I know that Cersei and Jaime are villains, but I find myself pulling for them right now (with the exception of Margaery Tyrell (Lannister) whom I find really victimized). But those sparrows are so despicable. They represent a contrived religion that calls to mind the Spanish Inquisition. They are smug and dangerous and don't seem to practice much of what they preach. I'm really looking forward to this ineluctable collision. I still don't quite know what Arya's endgame is. I think I lost it in some of the deluge of events. Where is that dragon? Dany is playing a bit of a waiting game. There are so many characters who are soon to be rising from the ashes. John Snow has literally done so. This episode, while lacking bombast, is laying a foundation of incredible explosiveness. Ramsay Bolton continues to lay down his slime trail. One wants so badly to wipe the disgusting grin off his face. He has been ""forced"" into patricide and infanticide, but the powers that be know what he is. What a magnificent villain he is! Anyway, it's going to be great fun watching things unfold."
627,52,9,1,"Greetings from Lithuania.""Oathbreaker"", the 3d episode in season 6 is a very good entry into season 6 so far. In this episode i loved everything for what i love this show overall - one of the kind settings, great acting, superb writing, directing and excellent pacing. Story itself is moving forward, i like the directions it's taking. After a magnificent episode ""Home"", ""Oathbreaker"" didn't disappointed. I loved the outcome with traitors in Castle Black and all the scenes with Jon Snow clicked right.Overall, we are 3 episodes in season 6 - and they all were beyond good. Can't wait for next entries."
628,52,10,1,Great episode. One of my favourites in this season
629,52,9,1,I really enjoyed this episode. mixed with humor & relax scene. and a few surprises.
630,52,8,1,"Speaking of this episode, I have to say that there are a lot of things in the episode that we might miss if we don't watch them properly. Moreover some weird nice or can be called magic we can watch this episode. Here are some glimpses of the old days, as well as some old ones. In this episode we can see all the things that we may not try to see. I agree, the episode is a little slower than the previous two episodes. But with that it has to be said that the episode is starting a lot new."
631,52,9,1,"It's not often one gets to exact revenge on his murderers, because one is often dead before one gets the chance to do so."
632,52,9,1,"Season 6, episode 3. Sam and Gilly are sailing to Horn Hill. Ayra is still in training to become No One. Bran is still training with the three-eyed raven - sees his father when he was younger. Ramsay gets a gift of Osha and Rickon Stark. Jon wants to know what happened to him, and leaves the Nights Watch. Cersei and Jaime are still picking up the pieces. Tommen talks to the High Sparrow.9.5/10"
633,52,9,1,"Some storylines are still starting up, while others are already paying dividends."
634,53,10,1,"Season 6 does it again, with another outstanding episode. It is perfectly paced this time around, with each character getting a reasonable amount of screen time without it being rushed over.The scenes with Tyrion and others have to some of his best scenes in a long time. The writing is yet again fantastic. Seeing two characters meet up again after so long, was one of the most tear-jerking scenes in a TV show period. Cersei becoming more of a bad ass this time around, gaining others to her side, and it looks like House Lannister and Tyrell might actually form an alliance. This episode was great throughout, there was not one dull moment, and again with Ramsey being one step ahead of everyone around him, leading to a shocking scene. But all of this leads to one of the best endings in the show so far. Throughout seasons 4-5, people have said that Dany has had little to do, but if they say that again after this episode, well, they are just haters. She shows her true powers, since season 1. It is all played around to feel like season 1 finale, and it doesn't disappoint. This also helps when there is an extraordinary soundtrack playing in the background.Brilliant episode, season 6 is the best season along with season 4. 10/10"
635,53,9,1,"Sansa arrives at Black Castle with Brienne and Podrick and reunites to Jon Snow, who has resigned from the Night's Watch after the deception of the betrayal of his brothers. Sansa tries to convince him to attack and retake Winterfell while Brienne meets Davos and Melisandre and warns that she killed Stannis and she does not forget or forgive the assassination of Renly through black magic. Littlefinger returns to Runestone and is welcomed by his nephew Robin and convinces him to send his army to protect Sansa at Castle Black. In Meereen, Tyrion negotiates a truce and the end of the support to the Sons of Harpy with the masters of Slaver's Bay. Jorah and Daario arrive at Vaes Dothrak and they meet Daenerys that explains a plan to them. Margaery meets the High Sparrow and he tells how he learned the truth. Tommen tells to Cersei that Margaery will be exposed to the people soon, and Cersei plots a scheme with Olenna to destroy the High Sparrow. Theon returns to the Iron Island and after a cold reception of Yara, he tells that he wants to support her. Ramsey stabs Osha with a knife killing her in Winterfell. Jon Snow receives a letter from Ramsey with insults and threatening him. Daenerys is brought to the khals in a temple and the set in motion her evil plan. ""Book of the Stranger"" is among the best episode of ""Game of Thrones"". Every segment is excellent and important, but the reunion of Sansa and Jon Snow and the final scene of Daenerys and the khals are spectacular. The encounter of Brienne with Davos and Melisandre is tense. Soon the viewers will certainly see the bloody war that is coming. The powerful music score in the end is another great attraction of this great show. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): ""Book of the Stranger"""
619,51,10,1,"This was a truly beautiful episode. The arc of the story doesn't really progress, but we are told who will be this season's or the next few episodes villains. The story continues with the dragons, the Lannisters. Stark's and the Ironclads.First of all, the writing here is brilliant, with the story heading in a great direction. This episode was also fast paced, with a lot happening within its run time. I expected many events that occurred during the episode to take place down the line, but I am glad they did it to begin with, because I can't wait to see what happens next.The sets, the production, bringing us back to meet our old characters, Bran for a start, was a joy to see. And how he has grown!This season really looks like it is going to be spectacular, with these two new episodes it is starting off to be the best season yet. 10/10 brilliant episode."

615,50,8,1,"While still way above other TV shows in quality, GoT is slowly drifting from the epic GRRM storytelling to the eternal Deus Ex Machina for TV Shows.The season premiere is predictable, pretty much uneventful (except for the closing scene) and is desperately trying to make us care for characters that simply have not had a good construction arc since their introduction. Tyrion and Varys steal the show for me though, I love 'em power couple.Defined in four words: your average GoT episode... and for a work inspired in ASOIF, I think that is not OK."
613,50,8,1,"I'm fascinated by people who expect every episode to be full of fights and encounters. Remember, when all is said and done, this is a single story. Lord of the Rings had to have ""The Two Towers"" to get to the ending. We have several key figures moving into new directions with all moving toward an unspecified center. We know for sure that Theon is regaining his humanity, acting heroically. Sansa is with him and alive and a pawn in the game, but necessary. Cersei is back at the castle. We are still in the dark about how much power she has. How have these religious fanatics affected the empire. The new queen is in the dungeon, being asked to confess. Dany finds herself in the hands of a warrior society similar to the one she left when becoming mother of dragons. The princess returns to the castle with Jaime, dead. And back home the evil women have formed a coup and murdered the bridegroom and his father. Arya is totally blind and is beaten with a wooden rod and asked to defend herself. I'm sure her role will come into focus again. And, of course, Brienne and Pod come to the rescue of the escapees and they swear their allegiance to Sansa once again. She now has purpose again and is a worthy foe to anyone. I, myself, am not even slightly disappointed with the setup. Have some patience, people."
592,48,10,1,"This episode is like an injection loaded with the purest form of adrenaline. Starts off as a great episode then gets better and better. Ends on a fantastic note. The last 15 minutes at mereen are simply incredible and i would rate it as the best episode of the season (I've seen the finale). Hardhome was incredible but this is even better. The fighting scenes are perhaps the best I've seen till date,the brilliance of this show matches the grandeur of this show which is simply unbelievable. game of thrones is among the finest things in the history of mankind,its far ahead than other shows that we see today. Cant thank the makers of this show enough. It is so raw and feels so real,GOT is a whole new world in itself. This is insane stuff and television doesnot get any better than this. Im sure by now u have got my point.Lool"
593,48,10,1,"Now this episode is going to shake the internet!!! there is so much happening in this episode I don't really now what my feelings are, I'm honestly sad, excited, and scared of what is going to happen next. Many book readers don't like that D&D changed some story lines, but I'm really grateful they did as they changed the show to the better. Arya never meets ser Meryn Trant, nor Daenerys is directly attacked by the sons of harpy, and oh my god,they just killed two more characters that are still alive in books.... I don't want to spoil who for those who still didn't watch the episode... Overall, this was a hell of an episode that you don't want to miss!"
594,48,10,1,"The Dance of Dragons is not only another classic episode, but it felt more emotional and compelling and it made me feel a bit sad. Mostly because of the choice Stannis made when he choose to sacrifice Shireen Baratheon, a sweet and innocent girl. I've heard that it polarized critics and fans of the books. Some liked it for it's strong character development while others hated it for betraying Stannis' character after the past few seasons. Anyway, everything else is so compelling.The characters are still believable, the story/script is well-written this time around, the action is great especially the end of the movie where Daenerys flies on her dragon which takes your breath away and the music score from Ramin Djawadi suited really well. The pacing is great and doesn't drag, the directing is great, the scenery/set/costumes are still gorgeous to look at, and the performances are still great. So, overall, another classic episode that is emotional and compelling. :)"
595,48,8,1,"I'm reading reviews that are all over the place. Apparently, some feel there are set of rules that can't be crossed. These folks should have stopped watching long ago. The series has pushed the envelope time after time after time. There's incest, sexual excess, nudity, graphic violence, on and on. The Game of Thrones is about power and the effects of power. When the little girl gets burned, many think the series has gone to far. It doesn't matter that numerous children have died in other episodes. What about the farm children that are the focus of Theon? This is a fiction and it's often about the worst of humanity. It's about every level of ambition possible. It is about people that see life as nothing, unless it's their own, and even then it's not valued. There are great scenes here. The final battle is quite amazing. Let's look at this series for what it is and stop imposing our own belief system on it. If you have very conservative views on this, it shouldn't be your cup of tea. I know that ""it is what it is"" is a cliché these days, but nothing is more apt. Also, quit comparing everything in the books to the film. Everyone knows that every adaptation that has been done is different from the final result. Hail ""King of Thrones"" for being honest and incredibly entertaining. I can't wait for the finale of Season 5."
596,48,10,1,"I can't even find a place to start. It was just that good. I can sense that people are going to be freaking out about a huge change from the books, but I don't even care. It was just such a good episode. I am shaking from hype. And to think, only one of the three things we're all anticipating happened. Imagine how the next episode is going to be. I don't even know what else to say. The only reason I'm still typing is because reviews require ten lines to be submitted. I thought the episode where Oberyn fought The Mountain would be hard to beat, but I was so wrong.I don't need to explain any further why this episode was awesome. If you saw it, you know exactly why."
597,48,10,1,"This episode shakes things up and about.Once again, I couldn't believe what was about to happen, and it happened. And then some more.Personally I don't mind alterations from the books, if that benefits the series. Especially if it helps break expectations.""Oh no, they won't. Something will happen and it will be OK.""""Nope. What did just happen?""And in the middle of finding your comfort, they stack some more on top of you in awesome fashion. This episode was overwhelming.It's 10/10."
598,48,10,1,"Now, for starters, this was a very good episode, excellent in fact. Just before the fourth season, the actors and the director gave us an indication how season four was going to be less focused on the ninth episode alone and that the season was going to have large plot movement all the way throughout the season. While i did not feel this was true in season four, this represents season five 100%. As normal, the acting and the drama in this episode is holding up to the series standards, even more so! In the previous seasons i have been, what can i say... Not as excited for the 10th episode, reason being the 9th installment. This season it is not the case at all. Having left Kings Landing untouched, i cannot wait for the 10th episode.All in all, great acting from everyone involved, and it succeeds to keep us very much interested after the excitement of ""Hardhome"".""Dance of Dragons"" is not only one of the greatest episodes so far, but it left the audience very much exited for the 10th episode. Which IF there is something GOT have been lacking is exactly that."
636,53,10,1,"Came to 'Game of Thrones' fairly late in the game and due to being so busy the binge-watching was gradual. Have found myself truly loving the show, very quickly becoming one of my favourites. It totally lives up to the hype and not only does it do the brilliant source material justice (a rarity in television) it is on its own merits one of the finest, most addictive and consistently compelling shows in recent years and quality-wise it puts a lot of films in recent years to shame.""Book of the Stranger"" is one of the best episodes of Season 6, which settled much quicker and more consistently than Season 5 generally, and a standout of the latter seasons, an episode that has everything that makes 'Game of Thrones' as great as it is and what it's all about. It is one of the most acclaimed episodes of the season, have also seen fans and critics cite it as one of the best 'Game of Thrones' episodes, and can totally see why on all counts. Never thought that another Season 6 episode could outdo the brilliant ""Home"", ""Book of the Stranger"" may have just managed that.While the whole story is tremendously absorbing with a lot of passion, sensitivity and emotional wallop, every 'Game of Thrones' episode has at least one standout scene even the weaker ones. ""Book of the Stranger"" has three, the Jon and Sansa reunion, Daenerys' conquering and the scene between Brienne, Davos and Melisandre. All three among the season's best scenes. Anything with Tyrion is awesome and also found the letter scene pretty harrowing with it showing how much a monster Ramsay is. The whole episode is packed with reunions, alliances and forward momentum in both story and characterisation, with plenty of surprises and emotion.'Game of Thrones' has always been consistent in the high quality of the acting. Particularly outstanding performances being from Emilia Clarke and Peter Dinklage.Visually, ""Book of the Stranger"" looks amazing, as one would expect for 'Game of Thrones'. The scenery is throughout spectacular, the sets are hugely atmospheric and beautiful on the eyes with a real meticulous eye for detail and the costumes suit the characters to a tee. The make-up is beautifully done. As well the cinematography and editing, which are cinematic quality as well.One cannot talk about ""Book of the Stranger"" without mentioning the thematically, orchestrally and atmospherically multi-layered music scoring and the unforgettable main theme. Again, worthy of a high-budget fantasy/action/drama film. The end scoring is especially powerful. The writing is thought-provoking and very rich in layers with plenty of passion and sensitivity. In conclusion, fantastic episode and a must watch. And this is coming from a genuine viewer who has not given every episode a 10 (have actually given my fair share of 8s and 9s) and has been honest in her opinions. 10/10 Bethany Cox"

That is a very tall order, because that episode was so special and actually saw even those who found the previous Season 5 episodes slow going (personally feel that although not on the same level as the previous four seasons, and a flawed one, that all Season 5's episodes ranged from good to outstanding, not a popular opinion probably) impressed. Although the polarisation of the fan reaction is understandable, count me in as somebody who loved ""The Dance of Dragons"" overall. Not without faults, no didn't think it was a perfect or 10/10 episode. The special effects have been much more polished before and the Dorne storyline (a consistent criticism of Season 5 among critics and fans) is not as interesting or as involving as the rest of the episode, also a bit silly.However, ""The Dance of Dragons"" is notable especially for two scenes. One is the whole climax in Meereen, especially in Daznak's Pit, which was spectacular, exciting and thrillingly intense with Daenerys' role being iconic for her and of the show visually and dramatically. The other is the episode's most controversial scene with Stannis and Shireen, one of the most tragic and disturbing of the whole of 'Game of Thrones' and the most hard-hitting the show has been since the Red Wedding. It shocked me and it brought me to tears.Am going to defend this scene now considering how much it's been criticised and talked about. Can understand the problems others had with this scene, with them showing dislike for Stannis turning from morally complex to a monster by one act which has been described as out of character and a character distortion. For me, that is true for book Stannis but not show Stannis, remember this is a character who would stop at nothing to get what he wants and he had shown numerous murderous traits actually since Season 2 and for trivial reasons, also he was much less wilful initially here than he was with those showing some moral complexity still. Getting back on track, once again cannot fault the acting, with strong performances from Emilia Clarke, Kit Harington, Carice Van Houten and particularly Stephen Dillane in some of his best acting as Stannis to date.Plot lines and character development continue to advance, there is a perfect balance of intricate character moments and drama and there is a powerful mix of heart-wrenching poignancy, nail-biting intensity and shocking revelations.Visually, ""The Dance of Dragons"" looks amazing (apart from the effects), as one would expect for 'Game of Thrones'. The scenery is throughout spectacular, the sets are hugely atmospheric and beautiful on the eyes with a real meticulous eye for detail and the costumes suit the characters to a tee. The make-up is beautifully done.

601,49,10,1,"If Elation was the word for Episode 9, its despair the word for Episode 10. Having already read the books prior, I was ready for what was to come. In spite of that, this episode was like a punch in my stomach. While many will talk about what happened at wall, I would look at the events at Dorne & Kings Landing. For the first time in 5 seasons, we had a episode that emotionally affected the Lannisters. They have been the hated characters of Game of Thrones - but am sure Episode 10 gave a different perspective to their characters. Lannisters - always pays their debt & the 2 events at Dorne & Kings Landing could have huge repercussions in next coming season.At the wall...its anyone's guess. Problem with guess work is it doesn't always work in Game of Thrones. All in all, a gripping season finale. Shame we have to wait for another 10 months to start all over..."
603,49,10,1,This was too good. Really unerrated episode. I'll give it 10 out of 10
606,50,8,1,"Last night, I saw the season premiere of Game of Thrones and from what I've got, it's really good. There are two problems I do have with this episode. I'm not going to spoil anything to those who haven't seen it, so I'm just going to point out the flaws and positive aspects.The plot progression does get very slow and didn't advance some of the story lines left by the fifth season. Also, some of the characters were given little to do and weren't fleshed out enough. Maybe things will get better throughout the sixth season, but only time will tell. For now, everything else turned out fine.The performances are still good, especially Lena Headey who shines with her emotional performance, the script is fine for the most part, the directing is very solid, the scenery is still gorgeous, the sets and costumes are still lavish to look at, and the music score from Ramin Djawadi is very beautiful. So, overall, not great, but a good start to Season 6. :)"
607,50,9,1,"Usually Game of Thrones start in first gear and usually pick up speed. But in season 6, they directly started in fourth gear. They started with all guns blazing bang bang. The episode touched upon almost all the sub-plots.The best moment for was when Cersei broke down in front of Jamie (not in a sadistic manner). In that moment a character as strong as Cersei started believing in prophecies. This showed her humane side. Because like all of us she also start believing in prophecies, Gods and monsters in our darkest times. Couldn't have asked for a better start of the show!!"
608,50,8,1,"If you look back on previous seasons, Melisandre has been given an exclusive preview of various plot developments but like any classic 'tinfoil theory' on a message board, has misinterpreted them. Despite this, the ending of this destined to be classic episode is a window into Melisandre's true powers and tells us that while human vice has threatened her clarity of perception, she does have a divine purpose as her centuries old survival proves. Perhaps those who doubted that Melisandre's blood magic ritual in Season 3 could have set the Red and Purple Wedding events in motion will now reconsider the vital role of this character in clearing the chessboard for the true war to commence. With all of these engrossing plot lines in motion, it seems to me that characters like Melisandre and Bran Stark have always served as the essential players in a much deeper story, so whilst the Littlefingers and Varyses manipulate the game of thrones, Melisandre envisions the song of ice and fire in which the great game will eventually be consumed. Through actions both hideous (the sacrifice of Shireen) and heroic (her validation of Jon Snow), Melisandre has moved through the series as a serene constant: highly organised and efficient and inured by an enormous responsibility. With her elegant gravitas, Carice van Houten has manifested the mystical potency of this saga as few others could and if the ending of this stunning episodes proves anything, it is that she has excelled in making the mythical heart of the story come alive for us all."
609,50,8,1,"Came to 'Game of Thrones' fairly late in the game and due to being so busy the binge-watching was gradual.

It totally lives up to the hype and not only does it do the brilliant source material justice (a rarity in television) it is on its own merits one of the finest, most addictive and consistently compelling shows in recent years and quality-wise it puts a lot of films in recent years to shame.Although it is a long way from being the best, or one of the best, season openers for 'Game of Thrones', Season 6 starts off very promisingly. It is easy to see why it has been positively reviewed by critics but also why it is divisive among fans and book fans. It does depart from the source material, especially in its treatment of Doran, even though somebody who always judges adaptations on their own terms not doing anything further with such an interesting character in the source material with more to give was a missed opportunity. There are certainly far better episodes in the season and of 'Game of Thrones' in general, but to me ""The Red Woman"" was very good, though with a couple of reservations. ""The Red Woman"" is at its weakest with the Dorne storyline. It was one of the biggest problems with the previous season and there is not much improvement. It is not particularly interesting and some of it is even cartoonish. Even more disappointing was its cheap treatment of Doran, one that was very rushed and abrupt and he deserved better.With such a lot going on in terms of story and character interaction, ""The Red Woman"" definitely would have benefitted from either being longer as an episode or having the events spread out as a two parter or something. Parts did feel hasty and it would perhaps have made the Dorne storyline better. A huge amount works here however. Character interaction-wise, faring best are Jaime and Cersei and in particular Sansa and Brienne, both intense and poignant. Loved what was done with Daenerys, even though brief, and felt sorry too for Arya. Davos shining more than he has been in a while was a plus as well. Another standout is the shock Melisandre reveal, that was harrowing. It is an episode that isn't action-heavy and doesn't advance existing storylines, with the main question on everyone's lips from ""Mother's Mercy"" being answered early on, but it sets up what is to follow well. 'Game of Thrones' has not faltered in the acting stakes and there is not a single bad performance. Standout performances are Lena Headey, Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, Emilia Clarke and Maisie Williams, while Carice Van Houten gives her best acting to date.Visually, ""The Red Woman"" looks amazing, as one would expect for 'Game of Thrones'.

Again, worthy of a high-budget fantasy/action/drama film.The writing is thought-provoking and there are no embarrassing lines this time (certainly not on the same level as that Sand Snake line in ""Mother's Mercy"". The storytelling mostly is passionate and sensitive, underwhelming only in Dorne. Overall, promising and very good. 8/10 Bethany Cox"
611,50,9,1,"This seasons start begins the story well with new and unexpected events. I feel a tad underwhelmed with some of it, however I feel there is so much more to come. As usual, I am left dangling with the future of characters and revelations brought by the end of the episode, with hope for more to come. First episode of the season, and I'm intrigued by what I'm seeing. Now that we've left the realm of the books, (I will admit I've yet to finish the 4th book of late), and now the story may or may not be true to what Martin wants the story to go. It still carried the weight of what has already been brought to the screen and I would like to think they will continue to do the series justice. Season 5 was rather weak in certain places so Season 6 should hopefully rise to the occasion."
600,49,10,1,"Well, this episode is in my opinion among the best ones, and absolutely the second best season ending (winds of winter is probably extremely hard, if not impossible to top)that we have had! This episode is very intense all the way through, and is extremely underrated! I see a lot of bad reviews for this episode and i cant seem to understand what the problem with this episode is! Its very intense, very entertaining, and has a insane ending, Which made it very hard to wait just three days (i got finished with got three days before season 6)!"
637,53,9,1,"The beginning of the episode touched my heart. When I met my loved ones after many conflicts, I felt exactly the same kind of happiness that I felt at that time. Another thing I noticed behind this is how a person can subdue everyone else just by the force of his intellect. But one thing this episode has taught me is that sometimes enemies have to think of friends as well. I also saw how diligent the Queen's Guards could be to save the Queen. Their lives have no value in front of the queen's life. If you do something wrong, it will always be considered wrong, be it the queen of a state or someone else. So what will the king do now? The mother and her honor on the one hand and the wife and her honor on the other. One man changed himself after enduring repeated tortures, but one day he returned home with the courage of another man to help his family. Some people become demons out of greed for power and some people are born as demons. A queen is always a queen. No one has ever been able to bind him, never will. All I can say is that there is an excitement hidden in everything in this episode."
638,53,10,1,"Another amazing episode, despite the fact that it is in the 6th season and the quality seems to be falling. Lots of interesting scenes and a lot of intensity. I will focus on one of Daenerys' top 10. The setting with the Dothraki leaders is one of the best moments that characterize the quality of the show, but also the excellent playing of the beloved Emilia. You are stunned by the style of dealing with Dothraki's leaders, the expression of devaluation and disgust towards them is one of the best I can remember. That's why I will get stuck many times in this episode and in this scene."
639,53,10,1,Good one. Really building up to a spectacular finale
664,56,9,1,"I've been reading a lot of people's opinions on this episode, with some calling it boring, others slow, but to me, I was reminded of Game of Thrones back during seasons 1 and 2. This builds up epic battles which will be taking place in the next few episodes and the tension here is spectacular. Without any spoilers, this episode starts of brilliantly, with an arrival of someone that made me smile from ear to ear. The Jon and Sansa's storyline was also very good here, as it will pay off when the big battle arrives. The scenes at Kings Lander were not all that important, with some good lines thrown in there, but little happening, but still enough to hold your interest.The Arya scenes were very well done, but very rushed. All of the episodes this season have been way too short, and there feels like they could have had time for some more scenes. However the best part about this episode is its build up, every character we see if thrown in a cliffhanger of sorts. Also the production this episode was outstanding, the sets the beautiful landscapes and new regions we have never seen before, were done so well. This is a slow episode but it is by far not boring, it was like the older episodes that built up tension that will pay off soon. 9/10"
665,56,9,1,"It's my first review, and I am writing it because this episode pleasantly surprised me.It was surprising how little cheesiness was in this episode compared to others in this season. And the dialogue was so much better, with some of Blackfish's quotes taking the top. And the final scene was really WTF for me, it contained the raw realism that Game of Thrones is known for. Overall, I haven't checked if they changed a director or screenwriter or something since the last change, but the approach is quite different and true to canon. It looks like someone who knows what GoT is about did it. Certainly not looking like a fan-fiction."
666,56,10,1,"Right from the beginning of the episode, you could tell this was going to be a special one and oh boy, did it deliver! This season really is amazing (thus far)and this episode is probably the second best, right behind ""The Door"". It really tries new things and kind of breaks the fold when it comes to the structure of a Thrones episode as it really is focused on one character, who has returned after 2 years of being presumably dead, and his arc throughout the episode; trying to adjust to a life without murder, but then ultimately being sucked back into that world in a tragic ending. We get a surprise guest appearance from Ian McShane who, of course, gives a fantastic performance and really makes you care for his character in just mere minutes of screen time, making the unfortunate twist at the end of the episode all the more sadder. Of course, there are other surprises and plot advances, which only bolster the episode, but I'd just like to mention the Riverrun plot line, which featured a great scene between Jaime and the Blackfish, and the return of the beloved Bronn. It's great to see Jaime becoming the man Tywin wanted him to be and getting his family and their house back together ever since his daughter died in his arms back in Season 5, which has clearly changed him, for better or worse. Unfortunately, Tyrion is absent for a second episode in a row, which is fine because if there's no story to tell, then just checking up on him would purely be filler, but I always miss him and Varys's banter. The only flaw with this episode is what it doesn't have, but it doesn't really need it either. Therefore: I'm going to give this episode a 9.7/10."
668,56,9,1,"Came to 'Game of Thrones' fairly late in the game and due to being so busy the binge-watching was gradual. Have found myself truly loving the show, very quickly becoming one of my favourites. It totally lives up to the hype and not only does it do the brilliant source material justice (a rarity in television) it is on its own merits one of the finest, most addictive and consistently compelling shows in recent years and quality-wise it puts a lot of films in recent years to shame.""The Broken Man"" may not quite be one of the best 'Game of Thrones' episodes. As far as Season 6 episodes go, it's not quite up there with ""Home"", ""Book of the Stranger"" and ""The Door"". That is in no way a knock because it is still a great episode that has almost everything that makes 'Game of Thrones' such a favourite. It doesn't matter that ""The Broken Man"" is not the most action-packed episode, that there aren't the big moments quite on the same level as other episodes and that it doesn't have as many bold revelations. What ""The Broken Man"" does brilliantly is the characterisation and development. One of the best episodes of Season 6 in this regard, plentiful and very rich, never less than interesting. It is one of those setting up episodes and putting things into place, again doing a great job with that and in a way that forwards momentum and like things are leading somewhere. It also does better than the previous Season 6 episodes for me actually in feeling the most like the first two seasons and like the show had gone back to its roots, possibly too the best Season 6 in general got in achieving this. No knocking here, just really liked that there was a return to this story approach. Did feel that Arya's scenes were a little rushed and didn't fit as comfortably as the rest of the more relevant and bigger events did, her biggest moment (her attack) is shocking though. Other than that, there are standout elements in the story and characters. In particular Sandor's return, the introduction of Lyanna, Blackfish (an awesome character), Jaime and Blackfish's interaction and the Riverrun siege. Have no issue with the performances with not a bad performance in the bunch, with the introductory and returning characters making just as much an impression as the regulars. Rory McCann is pretty scintillating, as is Clive Russell with some of the episode's best lines.Visually, ""The Broken Man"" looks amazing, as one would expect for 'Game of Thrones'. The scenery is throughout spectacular, the sets are hugely atmospheric and beautiful on the eyes with a real meticulous eye for detail and the costumes suit the characters to a tee. The make-up is beautifully done. As well the cinematography and editing, which are cinematic quality as well.One cannot talk about ""The Broken Man"" without mentioning the thematically, orchestrally and atmospherically multi-layered music scoring and the unforgettable main theme. Again, worthy of a high-budget fantasy/action/drama film. The end scoring is especially powerful. Plenty of layers, passion and sensitivity in the writing, loved that for Blackfish.In summary, great episode. 9/10 Bethany Cox"
669,56,9,1,"I really like this episode, planning for this, planning for that. the main plot here is gathering allies. to the final fight for the Throne. there are a lots of fight that is about to happen. Attack at Winterfell, Siege of Riverrun, The High Sparrow and Daenerys taking the throne. IT IS ABOUT TO HAPPEN !!!"
670,56,9,1,"Some episodes need to be created to give the story a new twist in order to move the story forward. Some episodes have to be made to talk about some people who have even pulled themselves out of death. Some episodes have to be made to convey some important things. As if no friend is with us in times of need, and those whom we used to keep away from as enemies became close to us. Some episodes have to be made to teach people something, to teach them something. Some episodes have to be made so that some stories can be collected to make the next episode better. So don't think badly about it, never think that this episode of this season was very necessary. So watch Game of Thrones."
671,56,10,1,Great episode. Lots of action and adventure and a great story
663,55,8,1,"Blood of my Blood is another great episode of the brilliant season 6, but is a slightly lesser achievement that the previous episodes. While it still has its twists and turns, with some great moments thrown in there, however it is, well ... slightly dull in parts.Like episode one, many characters are shoehorned into this episode, and with the absence of Tyrion, this episode does't have much humour. The episode starts off spectacularly, with Bran running into a new ally. This part was very well done, with a fantastic action scene thrown in there.Next we see Sam and Gilly, whom we have not seen in a few weeks. They arrive at his father's castle, and this scene too was very entertaining, but very rushed. The dinner scene that played out was very well done, with Sam's father coming across as very intimidating. But it is all wasted as the scenes feel too rushed and not very important.The part I was really looking forwards to was Jamie and House Tyrell coming to the Queen's rescue, and to confront the High Sparrow. I was a little disappointed. It was, like most of the episode, rushed. While the writing was great here, I wanted more of a confrontation, rather than people dressed up. The biggest complaint about this scene however, was the very obvious green-screen effect in the background. This is very unlike Game of Thrones, as they have such a great budget, but the CGI in this episode was poor.Now this episode is called Blood of my Blood, and it fits this episode perfectly, as it could reference both Bran's story line, or Dany's. And Dany's scenes were, also rushed out. This part was also very disappointing, as not only did nothing really happen, but how come we only saw like 100 Dothraki soldiers? This is another example in why it seems like they did not spend much time on this episode. I am sure there is an explanation for this, like keeping their budget for another ground breaking episode like the one before. We also finally get to see the dragon again, and the CGI on him is dreadful. I was watching it and all I could think was, the dragons looked better in season 2 than here. However this is still a great episode, and it is the weakest out of season 6 so far, but it is also understandable considering the episode that we had before, it was unlikely that they would top that.8.5/10"
672,56,8,1,"The highlight of this episode is the introduction of 10 year old bad-ass Lyanna Mormont. Brilliant! Other than that, it's a good, but not a great episode."
678,58,10,1,"Oh my god.. !!!! This is the real game of thrones. Bestest, Greatest television episode of all time. Kit (Jon snow) was awesome & magnificent. He was at the highest point of level of his skills & acting. Everything is so much perfect. I could watch it 100 times. It's masterpiece guys. Just go and watch!!!!"
679,58,10,1,"I just can't describe this. It was hyped up. The fight was coming. The fight that I just witnessed was the single most intense hour of television I have ever seen. I normally don't write reviews but this one needed it. I was wondering how it would play out, but this...I can't describe it. There were moments throughout the season, the subtle build-ups, the exposition, the intensity, that led me to believe this season would not disappoint. I did not expect it to culminate the way it did. I did not expect the production, the battle itself, everything came together as perfect as anything I've ever seen. I'm not one to get easily influenced physically by movies or TV, but my adrenaline was rushing through the entire episode. Game of Thrones topped everything they have ever done and I can't wait to see the consequences and results of the events in this episode."
680,58,10,1,"Holy hell! What a battle! This episode contained the single greatest battle sequence ever made for television, and I would even say it ranks high compared to movies. Miguel Sapochnik is now officially the best director on Game of Thrones (he also did last year's Hardhome). The pacing, the cinematography, the acting, the writing; everything in here was perfect. It depicts the horrors of war in such a brutal and stunning way. It feels like they've finally got the budget to take the series to the scale they've always wanted it at. Just an all around epic episode. It also plays sharp contrast to last week's episode, which I personally found slightly disappointing.Surprisingly, the episode isn't just set in one location (although it almost is). We also check in with Meereen, which is good because I thought the cliffhanger they were left on last episode would stretch for two weeks. It didn't. The episode leaps right into it. This was quite a smart pacing decision; by opening the episode with a battle, you prevent people from getting fed up with the long stretch of character scenes that precedes the other battle. Just the right amount of time was spent in Meereen this episode.But then, of course, it's on to the main event. The Battle of the Bastards. As with all the other big battle episodes in Game of Thrones, we check in with all the characters who will be fighting in the battle. It reminds us of the stakes, develops character, and builds anticipation.In this episode, we see that Ramsay is in fact a brilliant strategist. His battle plan is horrifying, manipulative, and very well thought out. The effects on the ground are very well portrayed. There is one tracking shot that follows a character through the battle that absolutely blew me away. It captures the sheer senselessness, the pure chaos of battle in such a mind-blowing way. The only thing I found even marginally disappointing about this episode was the character deaths; I wish there were more of them! But that's probably just me being masochistic.What an absolutely fantastic ride of an episode, I hope the finale delivers."
681,58,10,1,"Every once in a while you come across something that you know outright to be a masterpiece. It doesn't happen very often and usually even the greatest feats of cinema you have to watch a few times to appreciate the grandeur you have just witnessed. Game of Thrones is known for its strong 9th episodes on almost every season. Season 6 is no different with ""Battle of the Bastards"". It's a one hour television episode that truly feels like a massive budget blockbuster movie.This episode gives Game of Thrones fans almost one hour spectacle filled with action. However, the action is paced superbly with absolutely wonderfully acted and written dialogue. The episode involves many great changes, twists and turns. Episode director Miguel Sapochnik (also known for his another masterpiece episode ""Hardhome"") proves himself to be once and for all one of the greatest talents in the television and movie industry today. There are dozens of shots in this episode that I can't even begin to comprehend how on earth were they filmed. The action coordination combined with the great camera angles make some of the most memorable scenes I have ever seen in television.I don't want to go too much on details about the story itself, since this is best experienced without knowing too much about what is going to happen. All I can say is that all the story lines involved in this episode move forward just perfectly. Watching it all unfold on the screen creates an emotional roller coaster I've never seen in a Game of Thrones episode before. And that is saying a lot, considering how magnificent feats Game of Thrones has managed to pull through during its six seasons.I can safely say that this is my favorite Game of Thrones episode so far and season 6 is on it's way to become my favorite season. Something I didn't expect myself ever saying after finishing season 4 almost two years ago."
682,58,10,1,"Without giving much away, I can say with absolute certainty that the battle scene of this episode is by far the most cinematographically breathtaking visual representation of a battle. All the shots are great, it becomes evident to everyone how much time and energy was invested in the making of this episode. Apart from this, there are other things happening in this one-hour long episode, which are also terribly needed for future development of the show. What may HBO have for us in the season finale? Guess we'll have to see, but in the meantime we can rest assured that every time Miguel Sapochnik directs an episode we are going to be shocked and amazed at the same time. This guy really knows his stuff!"
683,58,10,1,"The Battle of Bastards is the Greatest Battle ever in the History of Television and Game of Thrones. The Episode was very Satisfying in terms of Action, Drama, Thrill, Battle and Kills.In Mereen, The Mother of Dragons would be glad to have Tyrion and Drogon on her side from now on. A new bond between to become Queens was also interesting.In North, The Battle, Oh My God!! It was something I have never ever witnessed. The Detail, the Armies, the Fight, everything was Incredible. The Game Ramsey played was so Ramsey. And the role Sansa took was so Stark. She really proved she is Ready to be the Lady of Winterfell."
684,58,10,1,"Episode 9 gives you the original taste of the Game of Thrones. Wao again I am going to watch it. After watching the last three episodes of this season I think that when it will be going to more excited. Finally, episode 9 break my expectation. What a war!! Yes, after 'The Rains of Castamere', 'Hardhome' and 'The Door' now 'The Battle of Bastards' is the greatest of Game of thrones. Best war direction, best visualization. Jon Snow is always best. What a performance by Iwan Rheon as Ramsay Bolton throughout the whole season. How can I now wait for next episode! When next Sunday will be come! Everyone should give 10/10 rating."
677,58,10,1,"Legendary episode is what comes to my mind after watching the episode. Makers, you gave us lot more than what was expected from this episode.Wow.. just wow.. This is with out a doubt the greatest episode in the history of television. What can I even say! Every part of the episode was great, every emotion was conveyed perfectly, I was crying and cheering nearly the whole way through. I'm sitting here after watching this episode and I just wonder how can an episode of a TV-Show make you feel so many intense feelings in just an hour...? I felt fear, I felt hate, I felt joy, i felt helpless, I felt like all my feelings were mixing together, and boy, it felt amazing! Overall I'd say that this was a brilliant episode that delivered everything expected and more."
686,58,10,1,"This episode reminded me of why I watch this show. After some sluggish episodes, the change in pace was refreshing and warmly welcomed. It's brutal and visceral but still has enough compulsion to get your emotions up in the air.I fully expected this episode to focus on in the brewing battle at the North, but it surprisingly starts off as a continuation of last week's episode. And this surprise adds even more to the episode. Daenerys is not the best ruler as we all know, but surprisingly she showed that she is wise in this episode by heeding to Tyrion's advice, which adds more complexities to her character. Tyrion-Dany partnership might just work on her favour, and I expect some dynamics between them next season. Not to mention the reunion of her three Dragons was thrilling and was one of the highlight of the episode, it sent down chills down my spine and had me on the edge of my seat. The CGI was epic for a TV show. The storyline also had the first confrontation between the Greyjoy siblings and Dany, which is a good suspenseful bid to pave way for her for the next season when she travels to the West.Now the battle between the two Bastards (namesake of the episode) was something I had been looking forward to since some episodes ago, and holy! The battle was executed so darn well. It was gritty, yet emotive. At first the battle goes awry for the Starks, but Sansa showed immense wiseness by swallowing her pride. Now don't get me wrong, Sansa has not my favourite character in the series, but the growth she has shown since season one is marvelous and Sophie's portrayal of her character complements it even more. I was not a happy viewer when the writers decided to bring back Jon because as a book reader I wanted Lady Stoneheart (aka Catelyn) to be the one to be back, but I can see why they made that decision. I could see vast glimpse of Lady Stoneheart's coldness in Sansa in this episode, especially at the brutal ending.The second highlight of the episode was the brutal ending to Ramsay. I could not help but shout with glorious retribution at the way his character met his death. Kudos to the writers! And that cold smile Sansa had, total Lady Stoneheart moment. Inspite of the thrilling, satisfying moment, the episode was not without emotions. I also wept for the horses that died (poor animals!).Anyway, I can say without a doubt that this has been the best episode this season, and had one of the best battle sequence in TV history. 10/10"
661,55,10,1,"Greetings from Lithuania.How to collide multiple story lines brilliantly and fascinatingly in one episode? ""Blood of My Blood"" in the Answer. I do not know what many of You guys saw in this episode that currently holds low 8,6 rating (in terms of this show) here at IMDb, but this episode blew me away - it is pure 10/10. Acting, directing, script, pacing (!) and all technical stuff are on the highest order - as (almost) always. There are multiple story lines here, which moved story forward - not hold it in the same path for a minute, and it was done in brilliantly crafted and unpredictable but always plausible ways. This season 6 doesn't take a break for an episode and it is one of the few best seasons yet, and ""Blood of My Blood"" in a one helluva ride. LOVED IT."
657,55,8,1,"Came to 'Game of Thrones' fairly late in the game and due to being so busy the binge-watching was gradual.

It is still a very well done episode though, despite having some faults, and to be honest following on from episodes as good as those two is daunting and for it to be on the same level would have been a monumental challenge. It doesn't achieve this challenge/feat completely, but it almost like because of the good elements being so good. There are faults here. Have to agree that Daenerys' role in the episode is dull and neither plot-progressing or develops her character much, her speech doesn't really stir the spirits either. Tommen's character needs to become more interesting because there is not enough to him yet to make him a love to hate him character, at the moment he's fairly ordinary. Jaime's development seems to have gone backwards rather than progressed. Pacing is occasionally a bit slow. However, there is a huge amount that works in ""Blood of My Blood"" that stops it from being bloodless. It is not as eventful or as tight pace-wise as the previous two episodes and revelations and such are milder and don't have the same amount of punch. The episode does do a great job with Sam and Gilly as well as the character of Benjen. Standing out just as much is the story with High Sparrow and Arya's character and story is progressing and the most interesting it was up to this point. Can't fault the acting. Jonathan Pryce was always great as High Sparrow, he's superb here. Maisie Williams is another standout, and Sam and Gilly are splendidly characterised.Visually, ""Blood of My Blood"" looks amazing, as one would expect for 'Game of Thrones'. The scenery is throughout spectacular, the sets are hugely atmospheric and beautiful on the eyes with a real meticulous eye for detail and the costumes suit the characters to a tee.

In conclusion, could have been much more but very well done on the most part. 8/10 Bethany Cox"
640,53,9,1,"Though I've cheered for Sansa from the beginning, the performance of Sophie Turner just wasn't what it should have been. As a late-comer to GAME OF THRONES I had first seen her in BARELY LETHAL, so I knew she was capable of living up to expectations. Less physical performance in this episode, but with acting that makes her the standout character... Well, till the end, Daenerys of course adds fire in more ways than one...So, Sansa made it an eight, and Daenerys made it a nine."
641,53,10,1,Seriously.. it's one of the best episode!! Especially the last minutes gave me goosebumps and attracted me to what people thought of this episode and i was amazed to find that some people were kind of bored! Seriously!? I can't believe it..
642,53,9,1,"Fast Story-Telling, Good writting. Lots of great scenes. so much happen in this episode. and building up to the Wars to come. This episode show us what is gonna happen in this season."
644,54,10,1,"How should I start???? Wow This episode was a mixture of emotions and mysteries i never thought that they would top ""Hard home"" but they actually did with topnotch storytelling and keeping viewers on the edge of their seats. This is the best episode of the season and definitely one of the great ones. Finally game of thrones is getting the pace we all wanted and in this one oh boy You get that quite a lot . This season started off quite slow there were complains of game of thrones losing its charm and all that. I guess they are saving the best for last. you'll see plenty of new characters and start to understand them quickly that's why this show is so good it makes you care for the characters no matter how bad it is so watch it people before anyone spoils it for you ... It's Mind blowing ."
645,54,10,1,"A riveting episode, with a twist that left me speechless at the end. 'The Door', in many ways, highlights how pervasively the past lingers and colours the present, especially for members of the Stark family. This adds an element of poignancy to what is an ultimately shocking episode. We are introduced to new, compelling characters, the highlight among which is a Bravosi theatre troupe twisting the events that have previously occurred in Westeros. But plenty of time is devoted to more familiar faces as well, as we begin at The Wall, proceed to the Iron Islands and to Vaes Dorthrak, before we enter into Bran's mind, and learn the secrets that he learns. If you were disappointed with the start of Season 6, don't worry - this is where the plot thickens and the tension rises, while the action picks up."
646,54,10,1,"This episode is just a reminder of why this is absolutely the best show on TV, the quality of writing is ridiculous, there is no other piece of media in any form that makes me feel the way this show makes me feel. Absolutely astonishing in every possible way, head and shoulders above any other show or movie or book in my opinion. This show hit its stride in the first season and has rarely slowed down even a little, and when it did it consistently raced ahead later on in the season Exciting, funny, harrowing, beautiful and terrifying, saying this show has it all is an understatement. This episode (among some other notable episodes) had me in shock. 10 out of mutha-f**king 10."
647,54,10,1,"I was sitting at the very edge of my seat during the last few minutes of this episode. It was explosive, mind-blowing, and having ramifications that would completely alter the Game of Thrones universe. Bran's new ability that is revealed during the closing moments of this episode is the biggest thing in the show since the White Walker's existence was proved.The storyboarding is once again epic. The episode was perfectly paced and so is this season so far. It started off very slow and it looked like the showrunners are stalling the storyline. But now we know, it was all a perfect setup for this mid-season climax.Suffices to say, tonight's episode ranks among the very best of GoT. The storyline has finally picked up some pace this season and old mysteries are being unraveled.I definitely, look forward to next week's episode in the hope that it will continue what's been set off in 'The Door' and build on it in a massive way!"
659,55,10,1,"For a while, I was thinking of not reviewing this episode at all since there's nothing really mind-blowing about it, and upon first watching ""Blood of My Blood"", I was rather disappointed with the episode, which is what I expected, coming off of last week's near-perfect episode. However, when I sat down with my parents and watched it for a second time, I realised that this episode is much better than I remembered as it executes just about everything it does flawlessly and it really is a perfect example of how Game of Thrones is great at drama as well as violence and fantasy. It dials back on the momentum that previous episodes had and lets its story lines take their time, making it a rather small & self-contained episode that mainly comprises of just three major story lines; Arya's, King's Landing's and Sam's. Also, it perfectly meshes humour & tension with Sam's story-line whilst giving us a few surprises with the King's Landing plot and it sets up an exciting next episode for Arya. We get surprise returns from three characters that have been absent from the show for years, and the episode ends on a spectacular note, reminding us why this show is so special. Overrall, this episode is a neat little gem and while it won't be remembered as one of Thrones' greats, it's still a fantastic episode that effortlessly blends fantasy and drama, whilst also balancing a few twists & turns with setup that makes me eager for the next episode. My score for the episode: 9.6/10."
648,54,10,1,"Amazing end here. It is so dramatic and effective. Brilliant story for Hodor. This episode is the answer of ""How can this basic character be a complicated character?"" This episode is really good."
650,54,10,1,No comments. This is the first episode of GoT that made my eyes water. There were many emotional parts before and I never cried to those. Something about this episode: The acting or the background score idk. But it really made me emotional.
651,54,10,1,"This episode gives me chills. It has such a magnificent ending. It's admittedly not an entirely new idea, but it's performed so very, very well."
652,54,10,1,This single episode maid me realize why Game Of Thrones is the most well written show of all time.
451,34,8,1,"Story (4/5)We learn lots of new things in this.
Soundtrack (4/5)Dialog (5/5)Graphic (4/5)Reasonableness (4/5)Entertainment (3.5/5)Overall (4/5)"
654,54,10,1,"Others have done fine in recounting the events. I will only add that we now have the pieces there. Big battles are ahead with forces in place. Right now we don't know the relative strengths because the alliances aren't totally clear. Arya is a rogue and has her own agenda. We need to understand why she has suffered the ordeal she has; what is her motivation. Of course, the Starks want to be renewed by showing their lineage. Bran is going to be the key piece in all this. So much is revealed here as to how the white walkers have managed to become what they are. Bran has to get control of himself before he can be a force. His inquisitiveness may be his undoing. The thing with Hodor is a wonderful piece that brings knowledge to us. This season is rolling along too fast."
655,54,10,1,"*SPOILER FREE*This episode is beyond amazing! I would say this is one of the most important and thrilling episodes in recent times. It would clear many of your doubts and questions, and the ending would simply give you chills. I wouldn't dare say anything about the story so I'm leaving it to you to watch and judge. I would give full points to the cinematography: every angle is beautifully shot and looks like a painting. Acting overall is brilliant. Sansa's character is becoming very interesting so I'm quite curious how much she's going to transform during this season. Bran and Hodor is phenomenal. Score is done brilliantly. Enough good to make you feel cold. Writing and directing is top notch. They can expect a lot of Emmys and probably Golden Globes this year.Now I'm curious about upcoming weeks. How they would top this one is beyond me. [10/10]."
656,55,9,1,"A beautiful episode transition. Great development of Sam arches, Arya and Daenerys. Although King's Landing has been anticlimactic, it demonstrated the ability of articulation and great strategic thinking of the High Sparrow, always masterfully played by Jonathan Pryce. Arya realize the injustice practiced by faceless men, and decides finally resume his Stark identity represented by the needle. Sam can, after two decades, to empower and make a decision that will influence your life, Gilly and baby. After so much suffering faced by Stark, it is strange to see that one of them survived. Oh, Walder Frey, and want you to die. Jaime seem to really regressed as a character and again turned marionette Cersei. And as icing on the cake, a small number of Bran views and a great scene of Daenerys."
649,54,10,1,"How can even one word mean so much?That's because George R. R. Martin, the master of worldbuilding, has unbelievably taken his incredible story to another level. Also known Sci-Fi writer, he's managed to do something amazing: Incorporate science fiction elements into a fantasy story that doesn't really need them but is even better with them.The passion and attention to detail makes up for an epic adventure but not without substance. Characters so rich that could even have their own show, even saying the word ""characters"" doesn't feel right, these are people. No good guys or bad guys, just people doing whatever they think is right or best for them.Why is Game of Thrones undeniably one of the best shows I've ever seen? Because it's one that cares so much about its story that even something as apparently meaningless as a repeated word by a seemingly comic relief character can mean more than meets the eye."
450,34,9,1,"Things just ain't easy in Game of Thrones. Fortunately the complications are entertaining - for us who's watching, that is."
0,0,9,1,"This is the first episode of the first season of Game of Thrones. It's nice to see a fantasy series make its way to television and become insanely popular. Based on the first episode, the visuals are almost cinema-quality and we are treated to lavish production design and a rousing score. We are also treated to ripe characterization and on the whole, this looks like it will be a blast. In this episode, ""The Winter Is Coming,"" we meet the Stark clan, the protectors of the North. The North is ruled by Eddard Stark and he has 2 daughters, 3 sons, and a bastard child. The king, King Robert wants Eddard to help protect him after the death of the previous Hand of the King. Meanwhile, across the seas, an exiled Viserys Targaryen marries his sister off to a nomad warlord in exchange for an army in which he can invade Westeros. Finally, trouble arises from the Wall Keepers when an ancient force, long seen as dead, awakens. As for television series go, this series has a very well-known, powerful cast. Peter Dinklage does a good job as Tyrion Lannister. Sean Bean is good as Eddard Stark and likewise Mark Addy as King Robert. Jason Momoa says very little as Khal Drogo, but his presence is menacing. Kit Harington as the bastard child, Jon Snow does a great job. I really like Sophie Turner as Sansa Stark and Richard Madden as Robb Stark. The list goes on and on here.....Lena Headey as Cersei Lannister, Emilia Clarke as Daenarys Targaryen....and so on. Overall, this is a fantastic start to what I hear is an incredible series. If this is the beginning of such epicness, then I am in for a treat. I like how the series does not shy down on its violence as there are some gruesome scenes here. But my oh my, what a start!My Grade: A"
448,34,9,1,"First of His Name does drag a bit longer, but aside from that, it does a great job continuing the story-arcs for the Starks and Lannisters after what happened to King Joffrey. The characters are still interesting and once again, they keep you interested to see what happens to them in the next few episodes.The storyline and script continues to be well-written, the performances are still superb especially Peter Dinklage (who continues to be even relatable than I thought), the relationships still shine, the music score is still beautiful, the scenery and sets are very lavish, the directing and editing is sharp, and it has a lot of great atmosphere within the relationships. So, overall, a nearly perfect episode for the fourth season."
141,8,10,1,"Baelor:This is the episode that all the moments in the season where building up to, it is also the set-up for the rest of the show to come...It has everything a perfect epsiode of television needs, the action, the suspense, the drama, the tragedy and climax. This is definitely one of the top 5 episodes of the show and one of the best episodes of television of all time."
142,9,10,1,"This is the tenth episode of the first season of Game of Thrones. It is a fitting finale and it foreshadows what seems to be a magnificent second season. This episode is emotionally-charged following the beheading of Ned Stark and what I really like is how we see each family member affected by his death. The episode has a tense, angry feel to it and it seems like vengeance is in the air. Plus the very ending....is just wow. Emilia Clarke is proving herself to be a wonderful actress. In this episode, ""Fire and Blood,"" the execution of Ned Stark has the Stark family in an emotional showdown. Robb Stark promises vengeance on the Lannisters. Meanwhile, Arya escapes from King's Landing and begins to travel up north. Jon Snow must decide whether he will be a Ranger or fight with Robb. Vaenary realizes keeping Drogo alive may not be the right thing to do. Tywin Lannister decides to send Tyrion to King's Landing to act as Hand of the King. Overall, this is one of the best episodes in the first season if not the very best. The ending is magnificent and it will definitely affect future seasons. A lot happens in the episode, so be sure not to blink an eye. My Grade: A+"
143,9,8,1,"The event that closed the previous episode (the most shocking ending to a TV show ever) opens the last episode of the first season, and from here nothing will ever be the same in the Seven Kingdoms. I need to mention great performances in this episode from Emilia Clarke, Iain Glenn, Michelle Fairley, Sophie Turner, Richard Madden and Kit Harrington. I have praised Little Maisie Williams as Arya Sark several times over previous episodes of the first season, and her performance is no less than you would expect from her, but she is given less to do here than one might hope. (Though we do see her turn the tables on a fat bully called Hot Pie who tries to steal Needle from her) Peter Dinklage shares a great scene with Charles Dance, when Tywin makes Tyrion the acting Hand of the King. Like Williams I have praised Dinklage an awful lot during the first season, and their performances have made the characters two of my favourites. With Daenerys and Jon Snow tying for third. The final moments of the episode, one of the most iconic scenes in the whole of the series are a wow moment. Bring on season 2"
144,9,10,1,"I can't add to some of the wonderful reviews by predecessors. I am reacting emotionally to something that has utterly captivated me. I am watching this series because of all the hoopla about it and all he awards it keeps winning. It just wasn't available to me until now. I am so pleased to have now entered into this masterpiece. All the forces are in play. The snot nosed king sits on the throne, showing us that he has no mercy but a venomous sociopathic nature. His mother sits on his right, perhaps wondering if this boy will some day turn on her. We have his betrothed, who, in an early scene, may have intended pushing him off a bridge, several stories high. She is Ned's daughter and is aware of what a mistake she has made in promising fealty to this lizard. We have rebel forces all over the place, including the horse people. Wait for the stunning conclusion of this episode which is a game changer. Jon Snow impulsively goes off to fight and brought back by his loyal friends, but his patience is rewarded. We have Bran still out there, helpless, but aware. His mother is engaging forces with her son. Tyrion has been given a leadership position by his father (Ned's former position of the Hand of the King), who has expressed nothing but disdain for him in the past, and then starts out by disobeying one of the few requirements. When he and Joffrey come together, it's going to be very interesting, to say the least. Father wields a great deal of power. So here we go. This is going to get better and better."
145,9,10,1,"The title of this review says it all. Never have I been so pulled into a series and made to care for its characters the way this show has done. This season has been overall spectacular in all departments.One of my favourite qualities of this series is that there are multiple connected story lines happening simultaneously, so the second half of the season is non-stop payoff with episodes drowning in riveting scenes. Almost every actor portrays their part flawlessly and the dialogue is sharp and unforgettable.The final two episodes might be the two best hours in television, and that says a lot considering the competition.Best Episode: Baelor (09) Best Actor: Sean Bean"
146,9,10,1,"As a fan of the series, loving both season 1 and 2 so far, I've recently rewatched season 1 and was struck at how epic this series really is. There are many good shows out there but for most shows, even the good ones, most scenes fade away with time. There is something different about ""Game of Thrones"" - akin to ""Star Wars"" in my estimation in the sense that there are characters and scenes that etch into one's consciousness (and from reading posts, I don't think I am the only one with this view). The final scene of season 1 is one of the best that I have ever seen on any screen - beautiful, powerful and transformative. Game of Thrones is marked with these moments of complete transformation - when you know the characters are forever changed and nothing will ever be the same."
147,9,10,1,"This season finale is suitably impressive after a wonderful first season which established Game of Thrones as one of the best TV series of the past 30 years. We continue to get dramatic developments, engaging character based scenes and an exciting ending leaving us full of anticipation for season 2.Season 1 follows the first book in the A Song of Ice and Fire book series pretty closely and a lot of the content and flow of this episode continue to do that and a lot of great dialogue is adapted closely from the source material. There are though a couple of scenes added into the mix such as an emotional scene when Robb and Catelyn react to the devastating news about Ned and the scene where Catelyn faces Jaime after they capture him. These are very good additions as both scenes are powerful and they fit nicely into the flow of the episode.Dany awakes from her traumatic childbirth to discover the 'healer' she trusted has betrayed that trust and not only has her child died but Drogo is not saved in the way she expected. The sadness of this scenario is well depicted and the interestingly ambiguous presentation of the actions of Mirri Maz Duur who has cruelly destroyed Dany's life even though Dany saved her. The 'maegi' presents her side of it which is that her life was destroyed by the Dothraki and she was stopping Drogo and his son from wreaking havoc on the world. It is left to us to judge or possibly see both sides equally.Jon's loyalty to his family is in sharp conflict with his loyalty to the Night's Watch having just made his oath before finding out his brother was riding South to war over their father's death. The book is able to present his inner conflict and his change of heart rather better but the way it is done with the main events and the great conversation with Mormont from the book done superbly well means it still works very well.We get a great scene between Tywin and Tyrion with Tywin realising he can trust Tyrion to go to King's Landing and try to gain control over Joffrey who has idiotically beheaded Ned just as Jaime has been captured. Charles Dance and Peter Dinklage shine as does the dialogue.Robb's followers declare him King in the North in a rousing scene and their new prisoner Jaime has us enthralled waiting to see how this will all pan out in the next series.Arya is taken by Yoren to meet her new travelling companions, men and boys bound for the Night's Watch including Gendry. This is very nicely done and Maisie Williams continues to hugely impress as Arya.The finale with Dany and Drogo's funeral pyre is a good wow moment to end on and signs off a magnificent season of brilliant drama.Another episode that is clearly 10/10."
148,9,10,1,"Fire and Blood is another classic episode in the first season of Game of Thrones. It hits all of the right emotions and it leaves you on a cliffhanger to what would really happen to some of the Stark family members in the future seasons while focusing on Daenerys and the Lannister family now that Sansa is with Joffrey now after her father Lord Ned was executed for treason.The story is still well-written, the script is great, the dialog is still fresh, the pacing is still more tighter and it takes it's time to develop the relationship and where it would go in the later seasons. And the music score from Ramin Djawadi hits the emotional moments really well. Much like the previous episode, I have no problem at all with this episode. I'm glad I decided to review the entire first season and only eleven more days until Season 6 arrives. So, overall, another classic episode that is more emotional and satisfying. Thumbs up from me! :)"
149,9,10,1,"The previous episode was a highlight of the season, but straight off it's followed by another soaring highlight. A great finale of the season!"
150,9,10,1,"Great season finale. Amazing episode.The writing, the twists, the acting. All of it great. The music is also fantastic by Ramin Djawadi.Emilia Clarke was great in this episode. Such a fine actress.10 out of 10. So.. Amazing."
151,9,10,1,"Game of Thrones is a show which delivers in all aspects that you would hope a big budget TV show would, and Season 1 is by far the strongest of all seasons to date. I have viewed the first season three times and have read the book twice, the adaption from book to the TV screen is simply faultless. This is true for season 1 at least however I am aware that in the later series differences between novel and show become all too common.With the first season being a perfect adaptation we are treated to the original dialogue and scripting which is such an amazing piece of work, I haven't seen many shows which deliver on this as well as Game of Thrones. Much of the show is a word for word copy of the novel which is always great to see, staying true to the book ensures we get the full experience, intended by the author. George R.R. Martin had a vital role in the production of the earlier seasons, being very hands on and controlling over how he wanted it to be portrayed.The first two episodes are relatively slow paced as characters are introduced and back stories are touched upon, from there on though it really starts to pick up momentum. Having fewer characters and families to focus on means that the pacing and storytelling moves very freely and flows at a rate which is very easy to follow and very easy to get addicted to. The Starks, Lannisters and Daenerys are the main focus over the 10 episodes, with the story also covering John Snow and the Nights Watch at the Wall. Characters aren't black and white, they have depth, different sides to them, many have mystery, with qualities you like and dislike. All characters are unique and from early on you start to get a gist of who is good and bad, likable and unlikeable.Game of Thrones isn't an action series however; its main strength is its dialogue, character relationships, character development and sublime story telling. The action we do see though is spectacularly violent and graphic, to the point where people have questioned the extremes of it. Seeing uncut gore and violence in something as mainstream as this is refreshing to see, language and sexual content are also very common with very little being held back. Game of Thrones excels in the 'shock factor', so often do things happen which come as a complete surprise, the first season alone has several of these moments, with each episode ending on an intriguing note, making you want to see what happens next. This can however be frustrating as for example, episode 3 could end on a cliff hanger with certain character and we may have to wait until episode 5 to be taken back to that particular storyline. This isn't an issue if you are binge watching the show but if you are watching it 1 episode weekly as it is aired it could become annoying.The amount of work that has gone into this is quite staggering, all the sets and costumes are fantastic and you can really tell that they haven't taken any short cuts during production. The filming locations are spot on, mixed in with the right amount of CGI, it brings the world to life with total realism. As Characters move around to different locations so often, much work has gone into the sets so we know instantly where they are, helping us keep up with the fast pace. Kings Landing, The Wall and Winterfell are all very distinguishable within seconds of new scenes.Game of Thrones makes a bold statement that it doesn't hold back when it comes to controversial subjects. It tackles them full on, showing complete ignorance to the easily offended, saying 'if you don't like it, simply do not watch it', and I respect that, very much.For me, the show declines in later series. George R.R. Martin has much more control over this season and it is very evident, especially when you have watched all seasons back to back. But as this is a review of Season One alone, I honestly cannot fault it and I would rate it as highly as any TV I have ever seen.A very easy 10/10."
152,9,10,1,"Baelor is the best episode of Season 1 followed by Fire and Blood and Winter is Coming, but this has to be my favorite episode of the season. It's just an episode that teaches how to do a finale. Tie off loose ends, end every arc for the season, and deliberately say what's gonna happen in Season 2 all while producing it's own shock and twists in its own way. These are all done magnificently in Game of Thrones' Season 1 Finale Fire and Blood. The season started a bit slow, but if you're a fan of this show you know that you'll be intrigued throughout the whole season and only makes you hyped to watch the better upcoming seasons. It is definitely one of the best seasons of the show since the Starks are all together here before being separated in the upcoming seasons. I would rate this season like a 9.5/10. A near perfect season that encapsulates the main families' philosophies all while producing it's own intrigue and suspense."
153,9,10,1,"The episode escalates the story beautifully, giving an epic finale to the 1st season. The ending with the birth of dragons and the transformation of Khaleesi into a mother of dragons and unburned, culminates in a genuine 10/10 episode."
154,9,9,1,"There really weren't many things happening in Game of Thrones' first season and therefore it seems quite disappointing that it's over by now and this episode already is a set-up for season 2. But that is definitely the only disappointing thing to find with this season finale. Directly continuing where 'Baelor' left off, 'Fire and Blood' shows us the dramatic aftermath of Eddard Stark's beheading. We see the reaction of every Stark family member and those scenes are some of the emotionally best in the series yet. After that, the matter changes somewhat too quickly, and Robb Stark's army is back to planning for war with all of them now recognizing the eldest Stark child as the true king of Westeros, however, this was also a very interesting moment. Preventing the story from dragging in the middle part are a great conversation between Tyrion and his father and Daenerys waking up again (in case you've forgotten: there was some serious stuff going on with her in the last episode too!)The only part that wasn't as good as it could've been was, once again, the storyline at the Night's Watch. Unfortunately, some of the acting was weak and the pacing didn't work very well either. All in all, I didn't feel as thrilled as I felt when I saw 'Baelor' for the first time. But then, there comes this awesome final scene that will impress the hell out of you. Emilia Clarke is completely Emmy-worthy in these last five minutes and the closing shot is freaking amazing.I really liked almost everything about 'Fire and Blood' and I would say that it's the 3rd best episode of GoT's first season. It's utterly entertaining and I could hardly think of a better way to end this excellent first season."
155,9,8,1,"Season 1, episode 10. The final episode of the first season - and it's a good ending to the great beginning. We've already witnessed a few deaths - some warranted, some not deserved. The first season ended with my heart heavy for certain characters remaining alive - in the seasons ahead I will know of their fates.8.5/10"
156,10,8,1,"The Lord Commander Mormont is tracking down Benjen Stark with the Night's Watch. Tyrion arrives in King's Landing to assume his position of Hand of the King making Cersei furious and he strikes back telling that she allowed the execution of Ned and the escape of Arya. Stannis has received the letter sent by Ned to him telling that he should be the heir of the throne and he sends copies of the letter to all Lords in the realm claiming that he is the legitimate successor. Cersei forces Littlefinger to find Arya threatening his life. Joffrey orders a massacre of Robert's bastards in King's Landing. Daenerys and her small group face starvation and she tries to feed her dragons anyway.""The North Remembers"" is another violent episode of ""Game of Thrones"". Now Stannis claims the Iron Throne and will fight the War. Littlefinger believes that knowledge is power but Cersei shows him that power is power actually. The slaughter of babies and children is impressive to keep the throne for Joffrey. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""The North Remembers"""
158,10,9,1,"There are so many plot elements going on here that to try to go through them is quite fruitless. Suffice it to say there are some incredibly stunning scenes. For one, Joffrey is taking it to new limits. He is so heartless and so cold. He decides a drunken man needs to drown in alcohol, forced down his throat. He confronts his mother calling her out for her responsibility in driving his father to produce bastards all over the kingdom, then sending out assassins to kill them, including a small child and a baby. Of course, the most dangerous of these would be Jon Snow. We see Tyrion gaining the position of Hand to the King, showing little if any respect for his master. Once again, the smallest person in the series, dominates the screen. He is the survivor, the intellectual, the true predictor of actions. There are other aspects of the wars going on with the multiple kings. Once again, there are so many irons in the fire and it is becoming difficult to interpret the alliances."
159,10,9,1,"This is the first episode of the second season of Game of Thrones. We pick up right where the first season left off amidst the turmoil occurring in the land of Westeros. As like it was in the first season, we seem to be getting plenty of strong performances and there are some new characters introduced such as the brothers of the late Robert Baratheon. The production design looks very sharp, sharper than your average television show. In this episode, ""The North Remembers,"" Tyrion Lannister arrives in Kings Landing where he is to act as the new King of the Hand. Meanwhile, Robb Stark ponders what to do next in the war, The Night Watch decide to trek north to figure out what is happening beyond the wall. Stannis Baratheon decides he is the rightful heir of the Iron Throne. Finally, Daenarys is out in the desert with what's left of her people struggling to survive. Overall, this is a solid start to the second season. It's an episode that is pretty much the aftermath of the last episode of the first season, but it introduces a path in which this season will take. Great acting is the key to the success of this show. I have a feeling that this will be Peter Dinklage's time to shine. My Grade: A-"
160,10,10,1,Way to start a season. Great episode.Fantastic work by all involved in this show. The music by Ramin Djawadi is awesome.10 out of 10. So.. Amazing.

Some part is a bit boring."
162,10,9,1,"Season 2, episode 1. There is a lot going on in this 1st second season episode - a hustle from every group to get things done and lined up for the battles ahead. A trade between Lannisters and Starks - family members for family members. The truth of who Joffrey really is out in the rumored open - the little Tyrant is getting worse. Daenerys, her dragons and her people are still on their way to Westeros - and so much more happening. Great opening for season 2!9.5/10"
140,8,10,1,"Came to 'Game of Thrones' fairly late in the game and due to being so busy the binge-watching was gradual. Have found myself truly loving the show, very quickly becoming one of my favourites. It totally lives up to the hype and not only does it do the brilliant source material justice (a rarity in television) it is on its own merits one of the finest, most addictive and consistently compelling shows in recent years and quality-wise it puts a lot of films in recent years to shame.Of a consistently great first season, ""Baelor"" is a strong contender for the best episode (certainly the best one up to that point) and one of the best episodes of 'Game of Thrones'. It was the most critically acclaimed episode up to this early nine-episode point of the show, and for good reason. As well as being as always superbly made, ""Baelor"" is also an emotional roller-coaster in a way that the previous episodes weren't as much (not that they weren't at all, on the contrary, just not to this extent).""Baelor"" is one of the show's richest in characterisation, story and themes and executes it in a way that's tightly paced, dramatically concise, never exposition-heavy, never rambling and not feeling too busy or bloated. Pieces of exposition here, like Tyrion's tent scene, are done tastefully and serve a point instead of being padding, giving great and interesting a chance to shine.Visually, ""Baelor"" looks amazing. The scenery is throughout spectacular, the sets are hugely atmospheric and beautiful on the eyes with a real meticulous eye for detail and the costumes suit the characters to a tee. The make-up is beautifully done. The visual effects are some of the best of any television programme and are not overused or abused, the scale, the detail and how they actually have character and soul are better than those in a lot of the big-budget blockbusters. As well the cinematography and editing, which are cinematic quality as well. The final shot has a powerful haunting quality.One cannot talk about ""Baelor"" without mentioning the thematically, orchestrally and atmospherically multi-layered music scoring and the unforgettable main theme. Again, worthy of a high-budget fantasy/action/drama film.It is hard not to be bowled over by the quality of the writing, outstanding isn't a strong enough adjective to describe how good the writing is once again. It always has a natural flow, is layered and thought-provoking and demonstrates a wide range of emotions such as suspenseful tension, poignant pathos and witty humour. As well as being one of the most thematically rich ones of Season 1, the story is paced beautifully, structured with such nuance and attention to coherence, a high emotional level and is done with intelligence, passion and sensitivity.The best scene, and the most acclaimed one, is the ballsy conclusion, which is both frightening and heart-wrenching and up there with the greatest and most shocking twists in television. Tyrion's tent scene is entertaining. Alan Taylor provides some of the best direction of the show, adding hugely to the conclusion's impact.All the characters are wonderfully written and layered, Tyrion for good reason is a favourite among fans and critics, while Ned epitomises morally complex nobility and Joffrey is like the devil incarnate in a young body, it is scary at how a character so young could be so evil. The introduction of the Freys is very well handled here. The acting is superb all round, standouts being Sean Bean, Jack Gleeson, Emilia Clarke, Maisie Williams and Peter Dinklage.In short, amazing episode that shocked and devastated me. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
163,10,9,1,A great start of the season! Some new and important characters are introduced (the number of characters seems to be ever increasing in this show).
139,8,10,1,"Season 1, episode 9. My heart dropped at the end of this episode. I was pleased to see Cersei trying to stop Joffrey at the very end. Joffrey proves he's nothing more than a bad seed it will be interesting to see how this plays out in the next few episodes. What bothers me is that Jon Snow never did get that last chat with his father Ned Stark about his real mother and Robb Stark was on his well on his way with his army to help their father. The two Stark daughters witnessed what happened first hand to their father Eddard. My blood boils at this point looking looking at Joffrey - the next few episodes will reveal more. 10/10"
137,8,10,1,"This is the ninth episode of the first season of Game of Thrones. Now up to this point, this has been a very good show that I have come to love, but each episode fell just short of perfection. Now we have finally reached an episode that reaches that elusive mark. I loved nearly every moment of this episode, but the end is the climax. I will say I have never met a character I despised as much as Joffrey, especially for his actions in this episode. In this episode, ""Baelor,"" Sansa begs for mercy so that her father can live. Joffrey agrees, but only on the condition that Ned admits he was a traitor. Ned refuses at first, but then comes to his senses as he realizes the importance of his children. Meanwhile, Arya escapes and lives as a peasant. Robb Stark proves to be an able general and declares war on the Lannisters. Tywin Lannister orders Tyrion to be in the vanguard of the army against the Stark army. Finally, Khal Drogo is seriously sick and Vaenary's reputation is nothing without him. Overall, this is the greatest episode yet of Game of Thrones. There is so much things going on, but it does not distract from the point of the show. There is great acting all around, but this is Sean Bean's time to shine. Did I say how much I hate King Joffrey? The ending is going to provide a great ripple effect, so it will be interesting to see how that happens. My Grade: A+"
114,6,10,1,"Story (5/5)Really really intense.

115,6,10,1,"This episode of Game of Thrones - ""You Win or You Die"" - shows just how far the art of television has come, and how it's beginning to surpass mainstream movies by and large."
116,7,9,1,"The Lannister guards slaughter Stark guards and staff and take Sansa arrested. They try to capture Arya, but Syrio Forel defends her and she escapes but finds her sword Needle and beings with her. When a boy tries to grab her, she accidentally kills him. Varys visits Ned in the dungeon and gives water to him and updates him with the news. Sansa agrees to send a letter to Robb to protect her father. Jon is frustrated that he cannot join his brother in the imminent war. He saves Commander Mormont during the night when a monster tries to kill him. Tyrion and Bronn are under siege of hill tribes and the cunning dwarf negotiates with them and they travel together to the place where the Lannister army is camped. Khal Drogo and his warriors destroy a village to take people to sell as slave to finance his invasion of the Seven Kingdoms. Daenerys orders to stop killing and raping the villagers and one of the Drogo's men offends Daenerys and challenges Drogo to fight with him. Drogo is wounded on his chest and one of the women she saved that is a witch treats his wound. Robb has a meeting with the lords and consolidates his leadership. When his men capture a Lannister scout, Robb releases him and sends a message to Lord Tywin telling that he will fight against him. Tyrion meets his father with the hill tribes that join their army. Sansa begs to her father's life in the court and Joffrey says that he will not kill Ned if he confesses his treason and recognizes him as king. ""The Pointy End"" is a great episode with many plot points. Varys is a despicable eunuch, serving the realm in order to be always with The Powers That Be. At the Wall, the dead raises when they are touched by the Night Walker. The strategy of Robb releasing the Lannister scout is certainly to lure Tywin. What will happen to Drogo? Ned will certainly not confess treason and how will he be saved? My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): ""The Pointy End"""
117,7,10,1,That Joffrey is a jerk too. Almost as bad as little finger
118,7,9,1,"This is the eighth episode of the first season of Game of Thrones. If you ask me, this is another excellent episode to put forth in this series. This episode is all about the Lannisters asserting their power over the Starks, and it is very interesting to watch. I particularly liked the addition of Charles Dance as Tywin Lannister. It's clear he hates his youngest son, but their conversations are very clever and engaging. Also, Richard Madden stands out in this episode as Robb Stark. He finally gets to be front and center, and he does it quite well.In this episode, ""The Pointy End,"" Ned is betrayed by the Lannisters and is set to rot away in a cell. Joffrey who now claims the title of king commands Robb Stark to commit fealty towards him. He agrees to come to Kings Landing, but this time with an army. The Night's Watch realizes that the White Walkers have returned. Finally, a disagreement ensues between Khal Drogo and one of his men over the issue of slavery.Overall, this is a great episode. It may not be the greatest episode to date, but it sure packs a punch. I thought the Night's Watch scenes could be tidied up a little bit more, but other than that this is a very fine episode.My Grade: A"
119,7,9,1,"Well, here we are. Heading into a series of battles. There appear to be few good guys. The queen and her smug son, who has ignored what the king wrote, and made himself the new king, is now feeling his oats. One problem is that he is antagonizing some that would be allies. These people are being laughed at and that may come back to bite him in the butt. Ned Stark rots in the dungeon while his daughter is being used as a pawn. She is naive and inexperienced, but she has the courage to ask the boy king for mercy for her father. Meanwhile, Tyrion is back in the presence of his father. Of course, there is no love for him other than his being a blood relative and demanding respect. He is by far the most intriguing of characters, many dimensional, devious and self centered, and as slippery as one can be. But, the big deal now is that all the forces are in place, and their collision will make up the last two episodes of the first season."
120,7,9,1,"Great, great episode with such a good ending/cliffhanger."
121,7,8,1,"In Episode 8 of Game Of Thrones things get very serious indeed for the Starks. Robb learns of his father's arrest and makes a decision from which there will be no turning back. My favourite scene of the season so far is in this episode, (Tyrions confession previously held it, with Arya's first 'dancing class before it) and it is one of the first, a pivotal moment featuring Arya and Syrio. Sansa's also has a significant role to play in this episode, Sophie Turner really shines in her scenes. Tyrion is back, and again he gets the best lines (when asked how he wants to die, his reply his hilarious) and he is forming a great double act with Bronn. We see Jon Snow and Khal Drogo in combat and both impress. Though Daenerys compassion (her ""gentle heart"" as Ser Jorah calls it) could cause her problems, but with Drogo by her side nobody will dare cross her. For my money this is the best episode to date."
122,7,9,1,"The Pointy End does a very successful job in setting up the last two episodes while still bringing character study to the Starks and Lannisters. Also, the relationship between Daenerys and Khal Drogo played by Jason Momoa is very interesting especially the way they speak the Dothraki language especially in the last few episodes. Also, the end scene where Joffrey promises to show mercy to Ned Stark if he confesses his treason and accept him as the rightful king is very intense. My only quibble is that some of the other side characters weren't given much to do, but it doesn't matter.It's still well-acted, it's still well-written, and the pacing is much tighter this time around. The music score still manages to be beautiful and the direction is really good. So, overall another great episode and a great set up to the last two episodes of Season 1."
123,7,9,1,"Came to 'Game of Thrones' fairly late in the game and due to being so busy the binge-watching was gradual. Have found myself truly loving the show, very quickly becoming one of my favourites. It totally lives up to the hype and not only does it do the brilliant source material justice (a rarity in television) it is on its own merits one of the finest, most addictive and consistently compelling shows in recent years and quality-wise it puts a lot of films in recent years to shame.'Game of Thrones' first season continues to keep going from strength to strength. There is not a bad episode in the season and to me ""The Pointy End"" is one of its best. Not sure about it being THE best though, for such a lot going on and being so rich in story and character occasionally it was a little too busy and could have had more time to breathe. A couple of the side characters are given short shrift somewhat too. Otherwise, ""The Pointy End"" is a wonderful episode.Already great characters like Tyrion and Arya are given plenty to do and have all of what makes them such good characters in the first place. Seeing Robb get the spotlight and mature was also a great strength, and any episode that makes Sansa interesting and sympathetic is deserving of a medal. The ending is a nail-biter and makes one want to see how the season ends, Syrio Forel's confrontation with the Lannisters is another highlight. Author George R. R. Martin's involvement is a large part to ""The Ponty End's"" success, before this episode he hadn't written a teleplay in a decade but he writes as if this big gap didn't happen.Visually, ""The Pointy End"" looks amazing. The scenery is throughout spectacular, the sets are hugely atmospheric and beautiful on the eyes with a real meticulous eye for detail and the costumes suit the characters to a tee. The make-up is beautifully done. The visual effects are some of the best of any television programme and are not overused or abused, the scale, the detail and how they actually have character and soul are better than those in a lot of the big-budget blockbusters. As well the cinematography and editing, which are cinematic quality as well.One cannot talk about ""The Pointy End"" without mentioning the thematically, orchestrally and atmospherically multi-layered music scoring and the unforgettable main theme. Again, worthy of a high-budget fantasy/action/drama film.It is hard not to be bowled over by the quality of the writing, outstanding isn't a strong enough adjective to describe how good the writing is once again. It always has a natural flow, is layered and thought-provoking and demonstrates a wide range of emotions such as suspenseful tension, poignant pathos and witty humour. As well as being one of the most thematically rich ones of Season 1, the story is paced beautifully, structured with such nuance and attention to coherence, a high emotional level and is done with intelligence, passion and sensitivity.Helped by the superb character and multi-layered writing throughout (some of the richest of Season 1 in fact), the acting is hard to find fault. Peter Dinklage, Sophie Turner and Richard Madden are particularly strong, Dinklage has always been a high-point of 'Game of Thrones' while the other two really allow their respective characters to grow.In short, an on point episode with almost everything executed wonderfully. 9/10 Bethany Cox"
124,7,10,1,"Another good episode, the story, acting and visuals. Great way of setting up the last two episodes.Fantastic.10 out of 10. Amazing."
125,7,8,1,"Story (4/5)Poor ned :(

Reasonableness (3.5/5)Entertainment (3.5/5)Overall (4/5)"
126,7,9,1,"""The Pointy End"" is another astonishing episode of Game of Thrones. There are many plot points to digest, but they are important to the final two episodes to close out the season. This episode was penned by no other than the GOT expert himself, George R.R. Martin. This was his first screenplay he wrote in over 15 years, and he certainly did a great job moving pieces around and getting everything in place. Great acting dominates the scene as usual. It's nice to have Peter Dinklage back as he was sorely missed last episode. His interactions with his father and while in danger with some hill tribes are fantastic! At least we learn how he intends to die. At the age of 80, drinking wine and bedding girls. Nice, Tyrion!This episode has the Lannisters asserting their power over the Starks. Ned Stark is rotting away in the dungeons, with the eunuch Varys as his only visitor. As least Varys keeps Ned in the loop and brings him bread and water in the process. It's not much better for the Stark girls. Arya is practicing with Sylvio when the Red Keep comes for her, but Sylvio forces her to run. Sansa is placed under arrest. Her engagement for Joffrey is still on and she still claims she loves him. However, she pleads for the release of his father. Joffrey promises her that he will not be killed if he admits he is the true king, and Cersei forces her to write a letter to her brother Robb to declare fealty of the new king.This episode is the first time we really see Robb in action. Robb gathers a huge army and sits at the head with the goal to attack the Lannisters. Robb sets free a Lannister guard and tells him to go to Tywin to say that they are coming. Catelyn reunites with Robb, but she loses Tyrion in the process.Speaking of which, Tyrion and Bronn escape from her clutches and ends up meeting a hill tribe bent on killing them. Through his sharp words, Tyrion manages to get the hill tribe to fight for the Lannister army. When arriving in Tywin's camp, Tywin looks less than pleased. But he may have a spot for the hill tribe after all.In order to pay for the war against the Seven Kingdoms, Drogo and the rest of the Dothraki plunders and rapes a village while selling their people into slavery. Daenerys wants them to end their practices, and Drogo agrees. But one Dothraki is not happy and challenges Drogo. Drogo ends up wounded, but can a witch work her wonders on Daenerys's husband?Finally, let's go to the North. Jon Snow is still not happy about his job assignment. Something has to make him spring into action, right? Maybe that thing could be.....a zombie! Yup, zombies (known as White Walkers) are ""alive"" and well beyond the wall. In a world without guns, it would be interesting to see how they adapt to killing these zombies. Luckily, Jon was able to save Commander Mormont from a gruesome death.Overall, this is another amazing episode thanks to the screenplay by Martin and the skillful direction of Daniel Minahan. It is somewhat of a talkative episode, but everything moves at a fast pace. No heavy or long monologues. Most of the dialogue is short and straight to the point. And of course, Tyrion adds the humor that we all so desperately love. Also, props must be given to Jack Gleeson. I absolutely loathe his character and wish all the bad luck in the world on him, but he plays his character with gusto and I applaud him for that!My Grade: A"
127,7,9,1,"This is a very good episode, it brings everything together in crazy action and intense moments. One thing I love that Game of Thrones has done so far is not have any characters be invincible, as a viewer you can feel each life as something that can be taken away at almost any moment. This results in a highly realistic style of storytelling I very much enjoy.I am also now looking forward to seeing the three main stories clash together, not necessarily in a battle (although that is probably what will happen).The hate for some of these characters is continually growing too. Not yet at the point of most hated fictional character but getting somewhat close.Overall I think this is the best episode of Game of Thrones so far, not in visuals, soundtrack, or even story development, but at pure entertainment of the rollercoaster this show has now become."
129,7,9,1,Storylines and character arcs are progressing nicely by now. Do we sense some decisive events on the horizon?
131,7,10,1,"Season 1, episode 8. Really intense episode - edge of your set. Now the Game of Thrones really begins - war is coming! Everyone is now scattered about and in position. This episode leaves you thirsting for more. 10/10"
132,8,8,1,"It's taken me a while to wrote this review, due to my feelings after watching it.WOW if I disliked the sissy Prince Joffery before this episode I despise him now!! And I've gone from wanting to slap him, to wanting to outright kill the little prat.Daenerys has to make a difficult decision, as does honourable Ned Stark. Oh noble Ned and his honour. His so Robb is forced to make some tough decisions of his own too. An old charmer named Walder Frey makes an appearance, and is decidedly sleazy. My favourite scene of the episode for me was a drinking game between Tyrion, Bronn and a prostitute Shae, where he revealed the tale of his doomed first marriage. If this was the year he won the Emmy it is deserved. I have loved watching his performances and he is a firm favourite of mine. But the most memorable part of this episode still has to be the end. I was in a furious shock!! And was straight on the phone to my brother (who has seen them all) going mad!! As I said in previous reviews, I am not a Sean Bean fan, and feel he is the weak link in everything I see him in (Goldeneye, Ronin, LOTR). But I love his Ned Stark, and he is excellent here. All bets are off after this episode."
133,8,10,1,The episode that gets you hooked on GOT. Absolutely brilliant
134,8,9,1,"This is directed at the plotting. I am thoroughly enjoying this wonderful series. One thing that continues to strike me, however, is the absolute ruthlessness of most of the people. Has everyone been disenfranchised? Is everyone living in fear? Ambition seems to be the utter driving force for most; that is understandable. But from his birth, Joffrey has been promised the kingdom. Like Macbeth, he plays most foul for it. His mother watches his machinations, but he is the one character that I despise the most among many. He appears to be a sociopath or a sadist. He kills for pleasure, not for ambition. Meanwhile, his mother sits next to him, barely batting an eye. I'm look forward to what happens between these two. There is no mercy, as we find out with Ned, who is willing to confess to save his daughters but doesn't figure the consequences. The armies are meeting. Snow has received a sword but has vowed to the knights. Khal Drogo has suffered an infection and appears to be dying, and the Missus goes to a sorceress for advice to try to keep him alive."
135,8,10,1,"I have seen so many movies and quite good TV shows in which usually i know that what is gonna happen next but in this episode, I am literally speechless for what i just saw in the end. As usual we have seen that at the time of death the hero somehow flee but when i saw in this episode was just mind blowing thing for me, I have never seen like that in my life where king is beheading and it quite certain leave a great impression."
136,8,10,1,"No way is this possible. how can a show be this good. Amazing.The acting, story, directing. Just amazing all around.10 out of 10 yet again. A really fast paced episode with a lot of stuff happening. This episode has action and good dialogues. It has everything you want from this show.Just.. Amazing."
138,8,10,1,"Baelor receives a perfect 10/10 from me. Why you may ask? Two reasons. 1) It raises the stakes and 2) The ending is not only well-written, but more frightening and dramatic possible. The first eight episodes were great, if not spectacular, but episode 9 is where things got real and it's a classic that engaged me from beginning to end.The story is great, the writing is still perfect, the pacing is much more tighter and took it's time to develop the characters' motivations, the music score from Ramin Djawadi is still excellent, the dialog is well-written, and the performances excel with the episode's dramatic moments.There are no problems that I have with this episode because I have never been blown away by an episode of a live-action TV show like this. Which is why I will tip my hat to the writers for doing a successful job in keeping engaged to what would happen to the Stark family and the Lannisters. So, overall, I'll say this once more, Baelor is a classic episode that is more frightening and dramatic. :)"
113,6,9,1,"Another good episode. ""When you play the game of thrones, you win or you die,"" Cersei says - which in time will prove to be quite accurate. For now, some are better at playing this sort of game than others, it seems ..."
165,10,10,1,"After director Timothy Van Patten introduced us to this epic series with the two captivating initial episodes, episodes 3-8 were engaging but slightly less convincing. Timothy Van Patten is an HBO veteran since ""Sex and the City"" and from ""Sopranos"" and ""The Pacific"" fame and was the right choice fine-tuning the take on this seductive and succulent source material. Having tackled two episodes of the perfect pitch period piece ""Rome"" and giving directorial birth to ""Game of Thrones"" he is now largely involved in ""Boardwalk Empire"", the other current HBO blockbuster and critically-acclaimed show.Alan Taylor, also involved in ""Sex and the City"", ""Sopranos"" and ""Boardwalk Empire"" too some lesser degree, worked on my all-time favourite series ""Six Feet Under"" and also on remarkable and more relevant ""Rome"". He arrives for Episodes 9 and 10 of season 1 of ""Game of Thrones"" and ups the game in almost all levels of storytelling. Now in season two he is in charge of the first two episodes including this one who is the best episode this series has seen thus far. Watching episode 3 of this second season, it became apparent that the show is not the same without Alan Taylor! Thankfully he directs two other episodes I have yet to see, later in this season. However, he is not slated to direct in season 3 as he is now involved with a Marvel feature film for Thor...All that said, this ""The North Remembers"" episode is to be remembered. From the beginning with King Joffrey's birthday celebration and sadistic humour interrupted by submissive Sansa Stark and new appointed Hand uncle Tyrion Lannister with a crisp arrival to King's Landing to the final murderous scenes, including brutal infanticide, that end the episode, every shot, dialogue and the specific and overall tones are on point. This is a strong episode on its own and also perfect resolution of last season's remaining questions as well as setting up the story lines for a potential exciting season 2. The next episode ""The Night Lands"" is also top notch, so here hoping other directors will follow Alan Taylor's lead and elevate the series with better scenes, acting, tension and pace."

Season 1 was of a consistently high standard, with its best episodes especially ""Baelor"" being 'Game of Thrones' high points, so of course expectations would be high. Luckily, ""The North Remembers"" lives up. Occasionally it's slightly rushed and it is agreed that the Littlefinger threatening Cersei to her face scene was just silly and not something Littlefinger would characteristically do. On the most part though, it's an exposition-heavy episode where almost all of it works, a lot happens and is introduced and it's handled in a lean way. The scene setting and the introduction of many characters and subplots were deftly balanced.Everything with Joffrey and the expansion of Tyrion's role were everything good.Visually, ""The North Remembers"" looks amazing.

201,13,8,1,"This episode carries quite a lot of shock value, but somewhat haltingly, I'd say. Fortunately there's still some heart as well, preventing the episode from getting all too bleak."
203,13,8,1,"Season 2, episode 4. Slow episode to me - things happen but not in a fast moving pace as I'm used to GoT being so far. The very ending of this episode left me scratching my head, wondering ""What did I miss? Did I miss something?"". I feel completely updated and satisfied with all the stories but the ending.8.5/10"
204,13,10,1,"I like how they call the bloke who makes hot pie, hot pie."
205,13,8,1,"Sometimes a point gets made and it is then beaten to death. I don't need to be reminded that there is cruelty in men, especially in men of power. We are experiencing these things in our present world. This is a marvelous series with great implications for bringing about a reign over all the different kingdoms. When there is battle, face to face, in a time of weaponry that is so primitive, there is going to be gore. But the scene with the two courtesans and Joffrey goes beyond the point of exposition. Then there are the tortures of the men with rats, even though they have no real information. Joffrey would have had his future queen ravaged by his soldiers for his own pleasure, telling them to spare her face. Do we need any more extravagances of violence? There are, however, interesting plot lines, including the facing off of brother, Tyrion continuing to bate the king, the motive of revenge for Arya. The arrival of the horse people to the golden city and their nearly gambling their lives away on principle. Then we have the final scene which is about as eerie and unexpected as anything so far."

It is the most violent episode up to this still early point of the show, and one of the show's most violent overall. This wasn't a problem with me, though it is understandable why others have objected, to me it didn't seem excessive or gratuitous being important for showing Joffrey's increasingly dark side. The somewhat ""what the heck"" ending may confound viewers understandably but it was interesting and does fuel interest in how the magic would be dealt with.On top of this, ""Garden of Bones"" also has a lot going on in the story and has a lot of characterisation going on. The good news is that it's all interesting and important, nothing is superfluous here with Quarth's introduction being one of the episode's highlights. As well as being the most violent episode up to this point, it's also the darkest and bleakest and is tied with ""Baelor"" as the most emotionally powerful.Visually, ""Garden of Bones"" looks amazing.

Joffrey's dark side is chilling.The direction is superb, one of the episode's best directed episodes, as is the acting. The meatiest material belongs to Peter Dinklage, Richard Madden, Jack Gleeson and Michelle Fairley and it shows in their performances. Dinklage continues to show why he is a show favourite, one would be here all night describing his brilliance. Fairley is very moving, likewise with Sophie Turner.Gleeson sends chills up the spine as an irredeemably evil character (it's not just his actions that make him so, it's also that one doesn't expect a character as young as him to commit the actions he does). Madden is very authoritative.In conclusion, a dark and disturbing episode but also a brilliant one. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
209,13,9,1,I had not really enjoyed Game of Thrones much. In Season 1 Only the last episode was fun. It seemed to get better with that episode. But even with Season 2. I did not really enjoy the first three episodes that much. But this episode was well made. Things started to move fast. Just like i Enjoy them. Now I know why this show has a big fan following. I hope it gets better for me.

213,14,8,1,"At the midway point of the second season this, is my favourite episode so far. Plot In A Paragraph:A King falls as the end of the Baratheon rivalry forces Catelyn to flee with Brianne. At King's Landing, Tyrion's source alerts him to Joffrey's flawed defence plan and secret weapon. Theon sets sail to prove he is worthy to be called Ironborn. In Harrenhal, Arya receives a special promise from Jaqen H'ghar, one of three prisoners she saved from the Gold Cloaks. Special praise for this episode must go to Maisie Williams, I have been vocal about my praise for her, and now she ups the game and is even more brilliant in her scene with Charles Dance. Both are superb. She also shares a brilliant scene with Jaqen H'ghar, the brilliant Tom Wlaschiha. I hope we get to see a lot more of him, given his promise to Arya it looks like we will."

My only complaint is, like other critics criticising the scene, the treatment of Renly. It just seemed so out of nowhere and rushed, judging from the aftermath too what should have been shocking came over as indifferent.Everything else is brilliant though. Standout scenes were two. One was the exchange between Arya and Tywin, which is very powerfully written and acted with one of the cast's most experienced and charismatic actors in Charles Dance being matched by a younger and less prolific one in Maisie Williams. The other is Brienne and Catelyn's pledge, with superlatively powerhouse performances from Gwendoline Christie and Michelle Fairley.Visually, ""The Ghost of Harrenhal"" looks amazing.

In summary, excellent. 9/10 Bethany Cox"
220,14,8,1,"The Ghost of Harrenhal is another good episode for Season 2, but it isn't nearly as great as the first four. My two quibbles is that the dialog is a mixed bag. There are some smart moments in the relationships, but some of the dialog didn't as engage me as I hoped. Also, while the story's still good and the writing's fine, very little happens and it left wanting to see what would happen next.Anyway, like I said, the story's still good and the script is well-written. The performances are still great from all involved, the pacing is still good, the direction is solid, and the music score continues to shine. So, overall, not nearly as great as I hoped, but another good episode for this season."
221,15,8,1,"With half the season over, trouble seems to be brewing everywhere and for everyone.Plot In a Paragraph: Theon completes his master stroke. The Lannisters send Myrcella from harm's way just in the nick of time when a riot breaks out in Kings Landing. Arya keeps running in To trouble and she comes face to face with a surprise visitor; Danaerys vows to take what is hers, whilst Jon Snow is given a chance to prove himself. Roose Bolton brings Robb disturbing news. I didn't think any character in ""Game Of Thrones"" would make me hate them as much as I do Joffery. Step forward Theon, you made the list. What a despicable swine. The high points of the episode feature two of my favourite characters and actors in the show. Tyrion Lannister finally unleashes his rage and anger at his nephew's monstrous cruelty and stupidity. The scene between Dinklage and Jack Gleeson is perfect. Not just because it sees Joffrey slapped. The interplay between the two is superb. And secondly once again Maisie Williams and Charles Dance are excellent in their scenes. I thin it's excellent seeing such a young actress showing so much confidence in performing with a veteran actor. One of the awesome things of Game Of Thrones that I've not yet mentioned is the opening. Whilst showing the map of Westeros, it shows us where we will visit in the episode. Much of Jon Snow's story beyond the Wall is also excellent, this episode introduces us to Ygritte, played by Rose Leslie, and she's excellent in the role. On the downside I'm still not convinced by the scenes with Robb and Talisa. It's not the fault of the actors, both Madden and the gorgeous Chaplin do fine, but the script seems as if it were written with two young 16 year olds. The best line of the show as usual still belongs to Tyrion ""We've had idiot kings, and we've had vicious kings, but I don't know if we've ever been blessed with a vicious idiot before!"""
222,15,10,1,"I can't add much to what has been said, other than to point out that my criticism of the last episode for gratuitous sex and violence (more of the sadistic variety) was quelled a bit. This episode, while not for shrinking violets, gave cause for the acts of its characters, so even if violence was employed, there was a logic to it. This could be one of the best of the episodes because we get inside the psyches of the ambitious and and the survivors. There is more humanity to the people. I've missed some of that. Joffrey and his mother really believe that somehow they have been wronged as Tyrion sees the big picture. Is Danaerys supposed to be a sympathetic character? Her continual demands to take her rightful place get kind of tiresome. I recognize that she is a supernatural being and has those dragons and everything, but when I saw the carnage of her people, it was the way the game seems to be played. Theon is also interesting. He is about as despicable as one can be and seems to be a hollow threat. Like Joffrey, he is impulsive and paranoid. When he is pushed by others he acts for them, not for himself."
223,15,9,1,"It's clearly best to watch ""The Old Gods and the New"" without knowing what to expect from it, so I won't get any specific with the plot and I'll limit myself to saying: it's awesome. The first Game of Thrones episode to be directed by Emmy winner David Nutter (who later went on to direct the undisputable #1 of all GoT episodes – ""The Rains of Castamere"") is an important turning point in season two, as everything points in the direction of war due to the events in this episode.In the Winterfell story part, things start to go down right from the beginning. And that is actually my problem with it: that it happens right at the beginning. I'm convinced that I'm not alone with the opinion that the breathtaking intensity overshadowed the whole subsequent scene – which is a well-written argument between Jon Snow and Qhorin Halfhand that should definitely not be overlooked. I'm being extra harsh on this subject and say that this is really bad editing because the Winterfell scene would've worked palpably better if used as the finale of an episode (either this one or the one before it). And while not as huge, the same applies for the King's Landing riots, however in this case, the next scene features Emilia Clarke even more feisty than usual and will gain your attention right away – even if you can still hear your heart beating as a response to what just happened. But I guess I really can't judge too hard considering the vast amount of things happening, with a lot of them differentiating from the source novel quite a lot. And in this case, I have to say that I enjoyed the version of Benioff and Weiss more than George R. R. Martin's.Besides those two scenes, which genuinely affected me, I had two other favorite moments in ""The Old Gods and the New"": the great suspense that comes up when Lord Baelish visits Tywin Lannister at Harrenhal who, as we know, is not aware of having the youngest Stark daughter as his cupbearer, and what happens beyond the Wall after the aforementioned Jon Snow scene. Introducing Rose Leslie as a new guest cast member, we meet the wildling Ygritte who is able to lift up the show's sex appeal (yeah, that fairly diminished with Brienne of Tarth) even though she has like half a dozen layers of clothes on. The first scene with here features one of this episode's logical goofs, but I connived at that as well since what follows is an icy pursuit that is one of the simplest but also most entertaining action sequences in season two thus far. But topping anything else is the bedtime scene with Jon and Ygritte and what I reckon to be the show's loveliest love story initiates. Not on the same level, but still surprisingly adorable to watch was Robb Stark continuing his flirtation with field nurse Talisa (sex appeal still rising). In the meantime, Jaqen H'ghar climbs higher and higher on the ladder of Game of Thrones' most awesome characters and the climactic situation at Qarth reaches a new apex with a shocking crime. You see? The plot is really fascinating in this one and the small flaws can't ultimately mar the entertainment I had while watching ""The Old Gods and the New"". Outstanding performances by Sophie Turner (Sansa Stark), Peter Dinklage (Tyrion Lannister), Emilia Clarke (Daenerys Targaryen), and newbie Rose Leslie additionally help it to become this season's best episode yet."
224,15,9,1,"Season 2, episode 6. Jon has Ygritte captured after the Knights Watch slaughtered those she was with. Theon has taken control of Winterfell and sends a raven out with word to Robb & Catelyn Stark. Daenerys bargins for ships. The people of King's Landing turn on Joffrey and the rest of the royals. Arya is still with Tywin Lannister - learning more of what is going on with her family. Jaquen H'ghar kills one more for Arya - she has one man left.9.5/10"
225,15,10,1,"Without question, this show is one of my top-ten favorite episodes of the show. I have no clue as to why this only has a 9.1. Without spoiling, I will say that this episode is beautifully directed, tensely written, and it opens so many doors in the show. Seriously, f***ing amazing episode, so underrated."
200,13,9,1,"Garden of Bones continues the story lines and it does a good job in doing so and the relationships begin to shine as the dialog is well-written and the performances are still amazing. The story lines are still good, the scenery is nice and the direction is really good. My only quibble is that it's a bit too violent. Don't get me wrong. I was fine with some of the violence in the previous episodes and even the first season, but the violence here seemed to be too extreme for me. Just saying.Anyway, this episode is great and I'm really looking forward to see how things will turn out in the next six episodes when I review them. :)"

199,13,8,1,"Robb Stark has another victory against the Lannister army. Arya Stark is imprisoned in a stable of an old castle with Gendry and Hot Pie, and they witness the torture and death of prisoners by sadistic torturers. Gendry is chosen to be tortured, but Lord Twyn Lannister arrives and interrupts the torture and assigns Arya for the kitchen. After acknowledging that Robb has defeated the Lannister army, Joffrey tortures Sansa with a crossbow and then he orders Meryn Trant to beat and strip her in front of the court. Tyrion arrives and stops the mistreating of Sansa. Littlefinger arrives at Renly's camp to avoid him to go to King's Landing but is not well succeeded. Then he delivers Ned's bones to Catelyn and proposes to exchange Arya and Sansa per Jaime. There is a meeting between Stannis and Renly but they do not have an agreement. Daenery and her group go to the City of Qarth and The Thirteen in principle do not welcome her. Davos brings Melisandre to the shore and the witch delivers a creature made of shadow. ""Garden of Bones"" has four great moments. The first is the wise attitudes taken by Tyrion. The second one is the witty dialog between Arya and Lord Twyn at the table. The third is the impressive attitude of royalty of Daenerys towards The Thirteen. And last but not the least, the foggy shadow creature that the witch gets birth. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Garden of Bones"""
197,13,9,1,"This is the fourth episode of the second season of Game of Thrones. One again, we have ourselves another magnificent episode. There is nothing ""big"" that goes on around here, but each storyline is once again, clever and engaging. We get great acting again as Peter Dinklage continues on his roll of magnificent performances as Lord Tyrion. We also get to see some barbaric cruelty from King Joffrey, with a very similar feel to a pornographic video. But that is a powerful scene to witness. In this episode, ""Garden of Bones,"" Robb Stark defeats Lannister forces and he meets a nurse named Talia. Tyrion puts a stop to his nephew's cruelty against Sansa. Vaenarys is introduced to the desert city of Quarth. Arya is imprisoned in Harrahall where she eventually meets Lord Tywin. Catelyn wants to unite Renly and Stannis, but that proves harder than thought. Finally, Lord Baelish visits with Renly who makes a promise to keep her daughters safe, but in return for Ser Jaime. Overall, this is a rather entertaining episode that has a lot going on. But I'm happy to report that each storyline is equally impressive. I loved the introduction to Quarth, the oasis city in the middle of nowhere. Just seeing the gates open brought chills down my spine. A very fun episode. My Grade: A"
171,11,8,1,"Arya is traveling with Yoren and the Night's Watch recruits when two Golden Cloaks arrive at their camping requesting Gendry, but Yoren uses his sword to send them back. However they promise to return with more guards. Cersei does not accept the peace terms proposed by Robb. Tyrion arrests Janos Stynt and names Bronn as the new Commander of the City Watch. Theon Greyjoy travels to the Iron Islands to meet his father Balon and deliver Robb's proposal of alliance that is immediately rejected by Balon. He also meets his sister Yara that is the pride and joy of Balon. Beyond the Wall, Jon Snow sees Craster leaving a baby in the woods during the night. He follows him but Craster hits him on the face.""The Night Lands"" shows Arya disclosing to Yoren who she is. The cunning Tyrion is against the babies slaughtering and Janos is the first one to pay for his action. Then has the coldest reception he could imagine from his father. Jon Snow snoops around Craster and gets in trouble. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""The Night Lands"""
172,11,9,1,"This is the second episode of the second season of Game of Thrones. For the most part, the episode is enjoyable. I particularly loved the acting of Peter Dinklage as Tyrion. He has two key scenes that will invoke laughter. His scenes regarding the dinner and with his sister are very memorable. I also liked the acting of Maisie Williams as Arya, who also provided some amusement. But one thing that may worth keeping an eye on is the use of gratuitous sex and incest. This episode uses those a little more than usual, and it's growing a bit weary. In this episode, ""The Night Lands,"" Arya becomes friends with Gendry, a child heading to the Night Watch. Tyrion tries to add balance to the king's affairs as he pleas with Cersei to set things right. Theon Greyjoy heads home to the Iron Lands where he sees his father for the first time in nine years. Vaenarys gets news back from her messengers as she and her people lay in the wasteland. Finally, Jon Snow investigates the actions of Craster. Overall, this is a really good episode that is fun and often entertaining. The use of sex is getting a little too much though, and it's clearly not a show to watch with your children. It's a slow episode in a manner of speaking, but still a good one. My Grade: B+/A-"
173,11,8,1,"The Night Lands is an episode that has a lot of great stuff, but also more than just a few disappointing aspects that mitigated my general view on it. Most of all, they decided to focus on sex even more than usual, especially increasing the incestuous content to an unsurpassed high. The inbreeding parts don't get really explicit, but just the mentioning of it, together with the baby-slaughtering in the previous episode, leads me to believe that this season of Game of Thrones is going to be a lot more unsuitable for children than before. That's not to say that I disliked seeing Carice van Houten nude, I'm solely questioning its necessity, especially since that particular scene wasn't even included in the novels. Anyway, as long as you don't watch it with your kids, the episode is still really nice entertainment.First of all, we have scenes with Arya again and they are some of the funniest moments the show has had up to that point. The conversation between her and Gendry, bastard son of the late King Robert, was absolutely natural and uplifting and definitely one of the most enjoyable scenes in The Night Lands, whose best part was undoubtedly Peter Dinklage's Tyrion who was present in two scenes and nailed it each time. The first one, him having dinner with Janos Slynt, the Commander of the City Watch, is hilarious and so well acted; the second one is another debate between him and Cersei that made me laugh my arse off (to stay in Game of Thrones British English) while also giving important background information. Another very good part of this episode was Littlefinger solacing Ros, which soon turned out to be a bit more than that and showed off Littlefinger's attitude so perfectly well. What happened when Theon Greyjoy visited his family is one of the incest facets the episode has to offer while actually being very entertaining and interesting since it gives us a lot of character insight.So much for the good parts about The Night Lands; the not bad, but not really good scenes were basically everything I didn't mention in the previous paragraph. Dragonstone, the freshly introduced new setting, already got a bit boring in this episode, however, if you haven't read the source material, it will definitely help you to understand all the new characters better. The attribute 'boring' can also be given to the scenes across the Narrow Sea where Daenerys and her khalasar of some two dozen people and most of them women are planning to attack the rest of Westeros. I'm utterly convinced that this plan will work.While not boring, the Night's Watch scenes were unappealing to me right from the start as unfunny fart jokes were made, while Kit Harrington did a really fine acting job and proved that he can be just a tiny bit amusing as well. The Night Lands ended in a scene with him that is bringing up the question: Is every Game of Thrones episode now going to end with a baby being killed?My conclusion: I did enjoy this episode, yet I found it to be one of the weakest episodes of the show yet. There were too much things happening that I didn't like and if it weren't for the numerous and circumstantial sex scenes, this would've easily been the most boring Game of Thrones episode yet. Keep in mind that my rating always augments a bit because of the show's visuals that never fail to impress me."
174,11,10,1,I like the bit where they use ravens to send messages to each other
175,11,10,1,"Good episode, slower but still really good. Really is a good build up to the season and episodes to come.Great music by Ramin and acting by Peter Dinklage.10 out of 10.Just amazing.."
176,11,9,1,"Arya makes an alliance. She is in constant danger and if found to be a girl, it will cost her her life. Finally she admits who she is to a man who shows her kindness (and knows she is not a boy). Tyrion confronts the queen and tells her that she is now known throughout the seven kingdoms as a baby killer. Of course, it was Joffrey behind this but that doesn't seem to matter. The desert wanderers get back a horse with a man's head. It leads to great distress, showing where the danger lies. One day these dragons will be mature and out. Something to look forward to as our young blonde warrior will flex her muscles at some point. We have a couple of father son meetings. We have those fighting for glory and stability, and we have the force of religion being tested."
178,11,8,1,"Plot In A Paragraph: Tyrion (the awesome Peter Dinklage) sets about sorting out the goings on at Kings Landing. On the road north, Arya (the brilliant Maisie Williams) shares a secret with Gendry, a Night's Watch recruit. Theon Greyjoy reunites with his father Balon, and sister Yara and asks them to join forces with Robb Stark. The scenes between Arya and Gendry are excellent, and Tyrion's cleaning house in King's Landing is superb. Bronn continues to be one of my favourite characters. I felt a great deal of sympathy for Theon Greyjoy as his return home to Pyke doesn't go as he planned. And Davos and Melisandre are both given more to do here, and both do the job very well. Of the new characters introduced, I have no complaints over Patrick Malahide as Balon Greyjoy, Gemma Whelan plays Yara Greyjoy well and Tom Wlaschiha is enjoyably quirky as Jaqen H'ghar, who is travelling with Arya and Gendry. This is a better episode than the last, mainly because it pays more attention to Arya's story. I became a massive fan of Maisie Williams portrayal of Arya Stark last season, and she continues to impress me this season."
180,11,8,1,"The various plots start unfolding, although at a rather leisurely speed compared to several other Game of Thrones episodes."
181,11,8,1,"One week was at least what I needed to recover considering the premiere propelled my spirit beyond the stars. However despite its cosmic qualities I have to admit that it wasn't as jaw dropping as Winter Is Coming. It featured many stellar scenes, like Daenerys taking care of her baby dragon or Jaime's hallucination, but it lacked a knocking out ending. This second episode delivered the cliffhanger we were hoping for but sadly I have to admit that it lacked some of the elements that made The North Remembers so outstanding.My first complain would be about the editing. I really missed how the parts were linked using the burning comet in the past installment. The mistake had already flawed the epic A Golden Crown in my opinion because it's inappropriate to cut sharp from one point of the kingdom to an other. So let's hope the upcoming episodes will surprise us with their creativity and fantastic metaphoras because a top notch production isn't enough. It leads us to the exotic sets because from Arya's lost woods to Theon's cliffs it felt like flying above Ireland, England and Scotland !My second major complain would go to the unbalanced development of some arcs. For instance Daenerys' one was way too short. Of course it wouldn't have been entertaining to witness their slow descent toward the river of thirst but her seeing a mirage or having a daynightmare about her precious creature could have been thrilling. In fact it seems this time the dream team behind the show decided to focus more on sexuality. The red-hot Melisandre (Carice van Houten) was back and she actually reminds me of Marion Zimmer Bradley's Avalon series. Such a feminist reference is inevitable considering the number of female characters that are now moving across the board. Theon's filthy rides were controversial and The Adventures of Lady Arya were promising. A charismatic sister, not a boy wanted by Cersei George R. R. Martin knows his classics and Littlefinger's cheering up one of his protégés was well staged.The fat guy's naive attitude seemed slightly misplaced but when it comes to Snow shivers are sent down my spine every time ! It feels like Martin was possessed by Stephen King while writing it and that Frank Darabont (The Mist, The Walking Dead) was hired to adapt it. Last but not least Tyrion's candles lighted face off with Cersei was wicked, one second you laugh the next you cry, and of course all the challenging mind games were exciting to follow.Note : This review was first posted on Kritikenstein, my weblog."

We learn more of Theon Greyjoy and his family while Robb Stark's story continues to march forward with easy with tension.

184,11,9,1,"Came to 'Game of Thrones' fairly late in the game and due to being so busy the binge-watching was gradual. Have found myself truly loving the show, very quickly becoming one of my favourites. It totally lives up to the hype and not only does it do the brilliant source material justice (a rarity in television) it is on its own merits one of the finest, most addictive and consistently compelling shows in recent years and quality-wise it puts a lot of films in recent years to shame.After a great Season 2 premiere in ""The North Remembers"", ""The Night Lands"" continues the high standard. It doesn't introduce as many plot lines or characters while still being exposition-heavy. Despite how that sounds this proved to be a good move due to much of the exposition being interesting and well-written, adding a lot to the characterisation. ""The Night Lands"" is moodier and darker than most episodes before it, certainly more so than ""The Night Remembers"" but no less intriguing.Will admit to have done without the sexual elements, they seemed gratuitous and could easily have been left out due to adding nothing to the characters or the story. That way, some of the pace could have been tightened. That is my sole complaint of an otherwise great episode.Visually, ""The Night Lands"" looks amazing. The scenery is throughout spectacular, the sets are hugely atmospheric and beautiful on the eyes with a real meticulous eye for detail and the costumes suit the characters to a tee. The make-up is beautifully done. The visual effects are some of the best of any television programme and are not overused or abused, the scale, the detail and how they actually have character and soul are better than those in a lot of the big-budget blockbusters. As well the cinematography and editing, which are cinematic quality as well.One cannot talk about ""The Night Lands"" without mentioning the thematically, orchestrally and atmospherically multi-layered music scoring and the unforgettable main theme. Again, worthy of a high-budget fantasy/action/drama film.It is hard not to be bowled over by the quality of the writing, outstanding isn't a strong enough adjective to describe how good the writing is once again. It always has a natural flow, is layered and thought-provoking and demonstrates a wide range of emotions such as suspenseful tension, poignant pathos and witty humour. The story is paced beautifully, structured with such nuance and attention to coherence, a high emotional level and is done with intelligence, passion and sensitivity.All the characters are wonderfully written and layered, liked the expansion of Arya, and the acting from especially Peter Dinklage and Kit Harrington is superb all round.To conclude, great. 9/10 Bethany Cox"
185,11,9,1,"Remember when we didn't see Arya in the first episode of Season 2? Well, no need to worry because her story arc has some plot advancement here as she makes a friend at the outskirts of the King's Landing named Gendry before he learns that she the daughter of Ned Stark as it turns out he met him before his execution. Also, the plot lines from the previous episode have been continued here including the City Watch guards searching for Gendry and Robb Stark, King of the North giving the Small Council terms (etc., etc.).The writing's still good, the performances are still great, the pacing is really good, the scenery is still gorgeous, and Ramin Djawadi continues to make more beautiful music here. My only quibble is the sex scene. Now, I heard that the first season had some sex moments but they were downplayed because it focused more on politics and character development. I won't spoil it to those who haven't seen the episode and the scene's not terrible, but I just didn't expect to have more of that here.So, overall, aside from the sex scene, The Night Lands is another great episode and continues the story lines from the first episode perfectly while advancing Arya's story arc where the last two episodes of Season 1 left off."
186,12,10,1,"This is the third episode of the second season of Game of Thrones. This is one of my favorite episodes of the season so far. I loved the themes of betrayal and cunning stealth. Peter Dinklage steals the show as the Hand of the King who uses his cleverness to prove loyalty to him. There is a good amount of action, especially when it comes to the end of the episode. The episode may be free of Vaenarys, but this is still an engaging episode.In this episode, ""What Is Dead May Never Die,"" Tyrion wants to prove the loyalty of the council, so he decides to test them. Theon Greyjoy is given a command of a ship as they decide to attack the North while Robb's forces are at war. Tyrion wants his new girlfriend, Shae to become a handmaiden of Sansa's. Bran is having his dreams, but he comes to realize they may be visions. Jon Snow is reprimanded after his encounter with Craster. Catelyn Stark meets with Renly Baratheon to see if he would join Robb's forces. Finally, Arya is taken captive. Overall, this is an outstanding episode in part to Peter Dinklage's amazing performance as Tyrion. The main reason to watch is just to see him outfox his council foes. But I found the other story lines to be actively engaging which makes this a very strong episode. My Grade: A+"
187,12,8,1,"Instantly continuing where we left off, ""What Is Dead May Never Die"" is calming the audience after a what I thought to be supremely ominous cliffhanger in the previous episode. Jon Snow is alright and Samwell gets to have his romantic moment. Sort of. Meanwhile, we have Catelyn starting her negotiations with the charismatic gay king Renly, a character that I'm very pleased to see again, Tyrion proving that he is a really smart cookie, and Theon having to decide which side of his two families he's on. And last but not least, there is a small but powerful battle scene at the end of the episode involving Arya.What stands out in this episode is clearly the way Tyrion, the new Hand of the King, detects Cersei's snitch – a method thoroughly entertaining to watch if you haven't read the books. Even if so, I'm sure you'll find pleasure in watching Peter Dinklage outshine everyone in the same room with him. I, however, found some flaws in Sansa encountering Shae for the first time, a scene that obviously needed more takes, in my humble opinion. Another con was Theon confronting his father, which didn't felt genuine and quite nondescript to watch. I simply dislike the whole idea of him coming back to Pyke and none of the scenes until this point as well as none of the scenes in the next two episodes (I've already seen them) made change my opinion about that.In the end, those two things didn't bother me a lot because as usual, the good stuff was predominant and I had great fun with the introduction of Margaery Tyrell in particular. Natalie Dormer is an utterly talented young actress who manages to keep her character interesting not only in a sexual sense (she's still hot, though). Gwendoline Christie does a fine job as Brienne of Tarth yet I have the same issue as with the Theon story part: I don't like the original idea by George R. R. Martin. The other returning cast members, Gethin Anthony and Finn Jones, sustain their good performances from season one while still keeping their relationship juicy. Altogether, this makes for some entertaining 50 minutes filled with the usual good acting, pretty set design, well-written dialogs, great score, and a final scene just as enthralling as the ones in the first two episodes."

Arya and Gendry Baratheon are taken away along with some of the others who were out looking for Gendry. 9.5/10"

There is a great scene when a disgusted Tyrion arrives and sees what happening. The acting is superb all round Jack Gleason has an excellent episode as the cruel king (God I hate Joffery) Sophie Turner is brilliant as poor Sansa, Again my love for Peter Dinklage continues, he is just outstanding. Rory McCann as The Hound doesn't do much, but his silent anger and disgust at Joffery is evident. But a stand out performer and quickly becoming a favourite of mine is Jerome Flynn as Bronn, he delivery of one of his lines had me laughing out loud. As I've already said along with Dinklage as Tyrion, I'm also a fan of Maisie Williams as Arya. There is a lot of Arya in this episode, which I like. After being missing from the last episode Danaerys is back and she has looked a lot better.

There is not a bad episode for me in the first season and, while not quite one of the season's very best episodes like ""Winter is Coming"" and the previous two episodes, ""You Win Or You Die"" doesn't disappoint. The overlong, repetitive and gratuitous expositional sex/prostitute scene with Littlefinger is the one drawback to a wonderful episode.""You Win or You Die"" has many scenes that work very well indeed. The final showdown with the Lannisters, the confrontation between Ned and Cersei, Drogo's rant regarding his son and the Iron Throne and Ned's moral dilemma between stubbornness and honourable intentions are particularly good, and Robert's final scene is very movingly written and acted. It was good to see the villainous characters given the spotlight, as it was to see the Dothraki at their most interesting and Khal Drogo emerging as an interesting character.Visually, ""You Win or You Die"" looks amazing. The scenery is throughout spectacular, the sets are hugely atmospheric and beautiful on the eyes with a real meticulous eye for detail and the costumes suit the characters to a tee. The make-up is beautifully done. The visual effects are some of the best of any television programme and are not overused or abused, the scale, the detail and how they actually have character and soul are better than those in a lot of the big-budget blockbusters. As well the cinematography and editing, which are cinematic quality as well.One cannot talk about ""You Win or You Die"" without mentioning the thematically, orchestrally and atmospherically multi-layered music scoring and the unforgettable main theme. Again, worthy of a high-budget fantasy/action/drama film.It is hard not to be bowled over by the quality of the writing, outstanding isn't a strong enough adjective to describe how good the writing is once again. It always has a natural flow, is layered and thought-provoking and demonstrates a wide range of emotions such as suspenseful tension, poignant pathos and witty humour. As well as being one of the most thematically rich ones of Season 1, the story is paced beautifully, structured with such nuance and attention to coherence, a high emotional level and is done with intelligence, passion and sensitivity.Helped by the superb character and multi-layered writing throughout, the acting is hard to find fault. There couldn't have been a more perfect choice for Lord Tywin than Charles Dance, while Sean Bean's dignity, Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau's ability to convey so much of the tension between him and Tywin with few lines, Mark Addy's poignancy, Emilia Clarke's expressive understatement, Jason Momoa's steely-eyed intensity and Aidan Gillen's broodiness also stand out greatly.Overall, with the exception of one scene this is wonderful. 9/10 Bethany Cox"
110,6,9,1,"You Win or You Die is another great episode so far and has gotten progressively better. The conversations continue to be interesting with some great tension especially the scene where Cersei Lannister and Ned Stark having a conversation about before she said this line.""When you play the game of thrones you win, or you die. There is no middle ground."" Lena Headley, the actress who plays Cersei Lannister in this episode, delivered that line in the most quiet and epic way possible. Kudos to the writers for creating that scene so great.The story is still good, the rest of the performances are still great, the script is terrific, the pacing, while a bit slower, is still fine, and the music score is still great and suited the scene between Cersei and Ned really well with a sense of eerie and subtlety. So, overall, another great episode and this season might get progressively better once I review the last three episodes."
30,1,9,1,"This episode is greatly underrated and over criticized. It sets up many plots for seasons to come, May not be nonstop action but its an absolute must watch for the series."
31,1,10,1,I like the bit with the dwarf. Especially when he gets drunk and bang chicks
32,1,9,1,"While the first episode frankly didn't do much for me, this one certainly got me interested. Things are picking up substantially. The pacing and atmosphere seems way better, and the characters are starting to come alive. I'm starting to connect with them."

35,1,10,1,"I found this 2nd episode better than the first one - I think mainly because I'm becoming more familiar with the characters, learning more about them... emotional. The ending of this episode really is a shocker and made me sick! I can't stand Joffrey and he's only getting started being really nasty in this episode. 10/10"
36,1,10,1,"The second episode is another great episode. Following the amazing pilot episode, this episode does not for the most part introduce any more character. It lets you get to know the character you got saw in the premier. It shows how much layered each character is.The acting, story and visuals. Everything about this episode just like any other episode of this show was amazing. Also the music by Ramin Djawadi. What a genius. Thank you HBO for this show. Best network ever."
37,1,9,1,"After the rather tragic ending of Game of Thrones series premiere, we are right back at it with ""The Kingsroad."" In terms of character development, this episode does a better job showing us the dimensions of these characters and getting us to care about them. We learn more about the relationship between Ned Stark and his wife, Cat and their history together. We learn just how manipulative and evil the Lannisters can be. The back half of this episode will drive that point home. One of my chief complaints about the first episode was that Daenarys Targaryen was not developed enough. The show does start to develop her character here and her dragon eggs that were given to her as a wedding gift is going to be of some significance. The atmosphere of this episode is tense, and that might be too kind of a word. The characters are brooding and in general, a sad bunch. Considering the events of the first episode, you can hardly blame them. This is an episode that is heavy-handed on character development, but it is a necessity. I was very eager to learn more about these characters.""A Winter is Coming"" ended with the tragic fall of Bran Stark after witnessing unpleasantry between the Jaime and Cersei Lannister. Bran now lies unconscious in his Winterfell home. Catelyn stays at his bedside day and night despite little hope for his recovery. Despite his son's injury, duty calls for Ned as he must leave Winterfell to travel to King's Landing with King Robert. The king and Ned agree that Sansa and the repulsive Joffrey must marry, which would unite their families. Ned brought his daughters with him and trouble happens with Arya is playing with a butcher's boy. Joffrey challenges the boy and that ends with the prince attacked by Arya's direwolf. King Robert passes fair punishment, although Cersei does not agree with his judgement. Meanwhile, Jon Snow travels to the Wall with his Uncle Benjen and Tyrion Lannister. Finally, we head across to the Narrow Sea where Daenarys is having trouble adjusting to married life. She recruits the help of a slave to learn how she could please her husband.This episode is great to watch and is also emotional at times. The scene with Arya's direwolf attacking Joffrey and the aftermath is hard to watch. This scene also shows how villainous Cersei can be. After the attack, Arya runs to the woods with her wolf and sets him free. In retaliation, Cersei demands that Sansa's direwolf to be punished instead. That was an emotional scene. Sansa's personality enables all of this to happen, but wow Cersei is quite the b...h. In defense of his daughters, Ned gives a rousing speech about how the direwolves are a symbol of the North but to no avail. And it is up to Ned to perform this nasty deed and as he does so, he realizes how his daughter was involved in a death of an innocent. Of course, we all blame Joffrey too.Overall, this episode is fantastic and full of character developments. We learn more about the history whether it's from Ned and Robert talking about why they waged war against the Mad King Targaryen or Tyrion describing how the Lannisters came into power. The acting is fantastic! Peter Dinklage delivers his dialogue in such an amazing way. Jack Gleeson, Lena Headey, Kit Harington, and Maisie Williams are all standouts in this episode. Plus, the episode ends with another cliffhanger regarding Bran. After these two great episodes, consider me hooked!My Grade: A-"
39,2,8,1,"In the third episode, Ned and his daughters finally reach the capital of King's Landing. Where we meet a host of new characters. We are introduced to Petyr Baelish (Aidan Gillen), aka ""Littlefinger,"" and Coneth Hill is perfect as Varys, the King's Master of Whisperers. The scenes at the Wall give us plenty of Tyrion, (which in my opinion is a good thing) There are a lot of fine moments in this episode, in particular a couple of scenes with Arya. The high point is the final scene which features Arya as she studies swordsmanship. Jaime's more fleshed out here. One of my favourite scenes was where Eddard enters the throne room (the first time we see both the throne room and the Iron Throne). It's another great tension filled scene between the two and I enjoyed it. Another great scene is the farewell between Jon and Tyrion. The scenes between the two of them have been some of my favourites so far, as I'm a bit sad that there may not be any more. But a key scene for this episode is between Ned and Arya, and how they spend their time together. Maisie Williams is showcased, and is predictably fantastic, it's a well done scene and Maisie seems capable of great chemistry with Sean Bean and, indeed, everyone else she acts with so far.Maisie Williams simply steals this episode for me. She had some good scenes including a rather hilarious line. Her scene with Ned (Sean Bean) was a touching one, and her scene with dancing master Syrio Forell is one of my favourites of the season so far. As for the rest of the cast Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau proves to be a fine pantomime villain as Jaime Lannister and Harry Lloyd is terrific as Viserys."
40,2,9,1,"From beginning to end the experience was even more immersive than in the previous installments. The last sequence with Arya brought me back to the time I was dreaming about Willow. What a refreshing ending ! And how worrying to turn her cute and joyful sword dance into a battle Ned remembered ! Is she destined to become a Joan of Arc ? Will she have to disguise as a man to fight beside her father and brothers ? Daenerys, Jon Snow There're so many characters to care about and others like Jaime Lannister to hate ! In fact I wonder why her evil brother is still alive. A king ? He seems all alone and powerless so I really hope we'll learn more about him in the upcoming episodes. But around them we really assisted to a ballet of wonders. From the exotic environments to the artifacts TV has never felt so fantastic. Comparing it to The Lord of the Rings trilogy is nearly an insult considering that show has already grown on us and imposed its own unique identity. Moreover once the episode was over I couldn't help imagining what would happen next and it's definitely the mark of greatness. The little boy in his bed who just woke up and wants to get scared because his reality couldn't be more frightening. The old lady did a vicious job at telling the story ! And what was happening on Jon's side perfectly matched her words. But in the end beside the majestic castles and bamboos in the wind the one scene I have decided to keep gently in a corner of my mind is the heartwarming passage between Ned and Arya in her bedroom. The most inspiring father and daughter relationship ! Last but not least I already want to learn Dothraki ! The unique language definitely contributes to the authenticity of the show."
41,2,9,1,"This is the third episode of the first season of Game of Thrones. There is nothing much in the way of action, but it does deliver on terms of political intrigue and rapid characterization. Everyone's character is developed even more in this episode. So far, my favorite scenes are the ones involving Ned Stark as the chief adviser to the king and Jon Snow in his training up north. In this episode, ""Lord Snow,"" Ned Stark and his daughters arrive in King's Landing and Ned is put to work right away. His wife comes to visit him to tell him about Bran's attempted murder. Jon Snow trains up north to much scorn but he may have found a Lannister friend. Meanwhile across the seas, Daenerys refuse to take orders from her brother. Overall, this is a rather great episode. It's light on the episode, but the political side of the show is prevalent and interesting. I also liked how Arya is training with the sword, despite going against the rules of society. My Grade: A"
42,2,9,1,"There is potential betrayal everywhere. The incestuous queen has a vision and it doesn't include her fat husband. She dotes on her son who is a frightened little ass who plans to run his kingdom on the backs of the northerners. His mother tells him to ignore what happens and he can make up his own stories later. Bran wakes but has no memory of things, but he knows he has permanently lost the use of his legs. There are so many pretenders now and how things shake out is what this show is about. What all would see as a little girl is beginning to show herself as the true warrior, but we will have to wait for that. Meanwhile, a winter like no one has seen seems to be entering. Winters here, like summers, can last for years."

44,2,8,1,"This episode I found a little slower than the first two - but it's good and a necessary part of the story. Best part about this was watching Viserys Targaryen get his! I'm sorry but I find him as bad as Joffrey, Joffrey's mother Cersei and her lover and brother Jamie Lannister. I dislike others but it's Viserys, Joffrey, Cersei and Jamie that I can't stand - yuck! The episodes will only get better as these 4 get worse. Thoroughly enjoying this series so far.8.5/10"
45,2,8,1,"Reviews Of Unusual Size! Re: Jon tries to adjust to life on the wall, Tyrion Pees, Arya practices, Richard drinks, the Lannister's scheme and Ned tries to adjust to life in the King's court.Outstanding: This was a pretty enjoyable episode, considering it was mostly about people wandering around and getting used to the new status quo. Then Syrio, Arya's ""Dancing"" instructor showed up and it became the best thing ever.Unacceptable: There might have been something I disliked, but the last scene wiped it away.Summary: Seriously, Syrio is so awesome, I can't stand it. He was in it for like.... 5 minutes, tops and he's my favorite character. The scenes on the wall were really great too, the way Tyrion subtly helps Jon. Man, I love the casting in this show.4/5"
46,2,9,1,"""Lord Snow"" is the Game of Thrones episode where most people agree that it finally came into its own. The characters we met in the first two episodes are further fleshed out and we meet some new characters who will play major roles throughout the series. We also visit King's Landing for the first time as we take our first look at the sunny capital of Westeros. What interests me, from the first three episodes, is how character-driven these episodes are. One would expect lots of action or sword-fighting from such a grand fantasy epic, but there has been limited action so far. The characters drive the plot and that is a relief because now we get to know who these characters are. The main theme here is political intrigue and I really like how the politics shape the events of Westeros and what is to come.Jon Snow takes the honor of the titular character. As we know from the first few episodes, he will be travelling to join the Night's Watch at the Wall, which separates the kingdom of Westeros and the cold, wintry North where the wildings live. Snow begins his training, but he is in for a rude awakening. He is being trained by Ser Allister, who makes Snow's life miserable. I guess that is what happens when a character is being trained to move from an arrogant rookie to a fearless leader. There is insight about how cruel life can be at the Wall. Luckily, we get another week of Tyrion at the wall. The name ""Lannister"" alone is enough to command respect of others. We see his scheming and we are left to wonder, what is his motivations? Is he in the league with Cersei and Jaime or does he have his own agenda? Peter Dinklage has been the standout of all the cast members so far and this episode is further proof. I really love his sarcastic demeanor, and I also liked how he subtly trains Snow. I also dig his bathroom off the wall routine.Let's go back to King's Landing. Ned Stark and his daughters arrive and Ned is put to work right away trying to figure out the murder of the previous Hand of the King. There are excellent character moments between Ned and Arya, played beautifully by Maisie Williams. Arya wants to be a warrior and she begins here with her sword master, Syrio Forel. The swordfighting display is a thing of beauty. I do love the interactions that Arya had with her father in this episode. The look in Ned Stark's eyes when he realizes that eventually his daughter will be a true warrior, not learning these techniques for the fun of it. Catelyn Stark also makes an appearance here. She travels to Kings Landing in secret to solve the attempt on Bran's life. There is where she runs into one of the king's advisors, Petyr ""Littlefinger"" Baelish (played wonderfully by Aidan Gillen). Cat was Baelish's crush before she got married. They end up reuniting and Baelish tells her that the knife from the attempt was his.....until it was won off him in a game of cards by a certain a Lannister. Because of this event, things will start developing as we move forward with the season. We also meet Lord Varys, an eunuch played by Conleth Hill and Grand Master Pycelle played by Julian Glover.Speaking of Lannisters, they certainly got good lines here. Cersei is grooming her petulant son of hers to be the next king and she drives the point home in such an odd way. She gives an odd, though rather indulgent way of telling her son he is going to be king. Jaime Lannister is given more to do and is developed more here. We learn that he killed the Mad King and also has some rather chewy lines. I loved his bantering with Ned Stark as we see The Iron Throne for the first time.Finally, we head across the Narrow Sea to follow the arc of Daenary's. Daenary finally shows some qualities about why she should not be messed with. Let's just say this. Her stupid, controlling brother, Visery is going to get what he deserves. His character I completely loathe. It is nice for a change that we do not get to focus on nudity this episode. She is given nuance and she began to show why she could be a capable leader. I also like that we learn more about the Dothraki people as a whole.Overall, this is a great episode that features lots of intrigue. There may be limited action, but the tension remains on high alert. If you like political stuff, this episode will be right up your alley!My Grade: A-"
47,2,8,1,"In this episode many new characters are introduced, several of which are vital to the main story line - not only in this season, but for years to come. Being new to the series, the sheer amount of characters and references may seem a bit bewildering. Still, the story moves nicely forward."
48,2,8,1,"After an attempted assassination, Ned Stark leaves for the King's landing with Arya and Sansa. Once they reach there, Ned learns that King Robert is bankrupted and will have Sansa marry Joffrey. Meanwhile, Jon Snow undergoes training to become a member of the Night's Watch.Lord Snow is another good episode in the first season, although not the same extend as the previous two. The pacing did get a bit tedious although it does a fine job to see what would happen once the Stark family stay with King Robert and his family. And while the dialog remains a bit fresh, it's not nearly as solid as the dialog in the first two episodes. However, those are the two complaints I have with the episode because everything else turned out fine.The story is still good, the script is still well-written, the performances are still great, and once again, the scenery and music score from Ramin Djawadi are beyond beautiful. Also, the conversations between Lord Ned and King Robert is interesting enough as are the other characters including a scene where he talks to Arya about why she hates Joffrey.So, overall, not nearly as good as the first two, but another good episode."
49,2,10,1,"Lots of fighting, nudity, drinking and sex. Keep up the good work"
50,2,9,1,"During this third episode, one can see that the relationship between the different families, and between members of the same family, is complex. The Lannisters appear to be a very powerful family, and not too ally of the king's house, which is Baratheon. Also Nedd Stark seems to be regretful about his choice, and duty, to follow his king to King's Landing. He starts to understand how things are there.Far in the North Wall, Jon Snow feels scammed because the Nights Watch is not the elite group he thought it was, but a group of mercenaries and criminals.Finally, back to King's Landing, king Robert shows his disgust for the Lannisters. Overall, interesting plot. Any watcher would like to see how events will end up. Winter is coming, and a new war is coming. This is just the.preamble."

Which does say a lot about the overall quality of 'Game of Thrones' as a show. The dialogue occasionally rambles and ""Lord Snow"" slightly suffers from trying to introduce new characters and concepts in a short space of time. Putting small emphasis on slightly because the characterisation is still superb and the ideas explored well, there was just the occasional sense of there being a little too many.Not many shows have their overall quality, tones, themes and characterisations so spot on and well-established when it first starts, but 'Game of Thrones' is one of the strongest exceptions. The slower, more reflective and loose feel to the storytelling was appreciated and actually was appropriate considering the character and story density.Visually, ""Lord Snow"" looks amazing.

That it is heavy exposition managed to just about work.Standout moments are the ending, Robert and the Kingsguard and Small Council scenes, while the father and daughter relationship and chemistry couldn't have been better depicted.Helped by the superb character and multi-layered writing throughout, Sean Bean and Kit Harrington both give some of their best ever work consistently in 'Game of Thrones', that can be seen here. Maisie Williams is really coming into her own and Peter Dinklage continues to be a high-point. Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau sinks his teeth into the character of Jaime and Syrio's role may be small but not one to forget. It is hard to pick standouts though because everybody here pulls out all the stops and nobody is bad.Overall, not quite as good as the previous two episodes but still excellent. 9/10 Bethany Cox"
54,2,9,1,"This episode in the adaptation of George R.R. Martin's books continues the strong start following two very good opening episodes.Ned Stark arrives in King's Landing taking up his duties as Hand to the King. He meets the two political geniuses Varys and 'Littlefinger' Baelish both of whom make immediate impact with finely acted scenes of dialogue. Sansa and Arya are with Ned and Catelyn Stark also arrives to investigate who may have attempted to kill their son Bran (who lies crippled back home in Winterfell). At this stage the intrigue is ramping up and the political game playing is kicking off chains of events which are as yet unclear. Baelish is at his best right away. His sliminess, leading you to not know if he is a hero or a villain, is played beautifully throughout every season and is evident straight away.Tyrion and Jon Snow have arrived at The Wall where Jon begins training with the highly unpleasant Ser Alliser Thorn making his life difficult. There are lovely scenes where Tyrion helps and advises Jon. Lord Commander Mormont and Maester Aemon appear too and are acted to perfection by James Cosmo and Peter Vaughan.King Robert continues to be played with brilliant bravado by Mark Addy and Barristan Selmy provides graceful company for him and Jaime in a fun scene comparing first kills.Viserys starts to see a tougher side emerging in his younger sister as she settles a little into her place as Khaleesi of the Dothraki horde.An additional delight is the appearance of the character Syrio Forel, Arya's 'dance' teacher who is charisma personified. An absolute gem of a performance which lights up the screen while teaching Arya her first sword skills.It is interesting to view Catelyn's choices when you know the books or re-watch years later knowing how it all pans out. I feel she has a lot to answer for in her very poor decision making in this as well as later episodes. Why does she need to travel to King's Landing at all when she could have just sent Ser Rodrick? Then when she gets there she influences Ned to make mistakes and trust people he shouldn't.Another excellent episode. 9/10"
28,1,8,1,"We find out that despite his great fall (after being pushed) that Bran is still alive (though he is unconscious). He poses a great threat. His mother attends to him to the exclusion of everything else. The king has his entourage and they go their ways. The new queen must learn to relax with her new husband, who is basically a barbarian. Back at the castle, things are getting tense because Bran's mother is getting wise to what took place before her son fell. The girls are also feeling their strength. The prince has taken a shine to one of them. He is pompous little snot and when he tries to show off, one of the direwolves attacks him. He lies to his father about what happened (in reality, he was bested by a little girl). It is ordered by the queen that one of the direwolves be killed and when he is an interesting thing happens. This is a really good narrative hook, going into the next episode."
55,3,9,1,"These little reviews are hard because of the number of characters that are wending their way to the unknown. The plotting is superb. We have strong women, strong men, powerless women, and powerless men. We start with Bran having a dream that he is following a raven which has three eyes. When he awakens, he goes to court and finds that Tyrion has figured a way to get him on a horse, using the proper prosthetics. We return to John, who is fighting every day, teaching a group of ineffectual men to be soldiers (or should we say, cannon fodder). We meet a new character, Samwell Tarley, who has been disowned by his father who hopes he will die in battle. John sees in him a brother in arms (he is actually the opposite, a coward, afraid of heights, and so on). We are introduced to the joust where a knight is horribly killed. There is more intrigue involving Stark and the King. There is an exchange of war stories that shows what a lesser creature the king is. The scene ends as Tyrion and his mouth seem to be heading into another realm."

24,1,9,1,"This is the second episode of the first season of Game of Thrones. It is a great follow-up to the pilot of the Game of Thrones. We can tell right away that the show does not have a problem being controversial, and there is yet another controversial happenstance in this episode. That being said, it's a quieter, more reflective episode, but that doesn't stop the show from being excellent. The ending is fantastic and kind of sad. In this episode, ""The Kingsroad,"" Ned Stark takes his daughters with him to Kings Landing where it's agreed that Sansa will marry Prince Joffey. Trouble arises when Arya's pet wolf attacks Joffey. Meanwhile, Bran is unconscious from his fall and little hope remains about his recovery. Jon Snow travels with his uncle to the Wall. Finally, Daenerys is having trouble pleasing her new husband, the warlord Khal Drogo. Overall, this is an excellent episode. The technical side of the series remain a high point. I really enjoyed the story throughout. It started slow, but picked up steam towards the end. The ending was quite a shocker. But after the first two episodes, consider me hooked. My Grade: A"
1,0,10,1,"Game of Thrones offers an epic on the scale of Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings and doesn't dumb-down the subject matter; this is fantasy for grown-ups.Visually this is on a par with many a cinematic effort. The effects which create castles and cities are of a high standard and the opening scene involving a foreboding, snow-covered wood was hauntingly beautiful. The costumes are superb; very original, with unusual and authentic-looking hair and makeup designs. The cinematography is simply beautiful, with some amazing wide shots (courtesy of the special effects) of the interesting landscapes on display, ranging from damp, Gothic castles to sweeping seascapes and deserts.This episode offered the perfect balance of dark scares, humour, drama and character-building. I'd heard beforehand it would be full of sex, violence and swearing. I thought the amount of each was entirely in proportion with the type of series this is and didn't find it gratuitous at all. I have never read the books but despite the complexity, with many families introduced and their myriad connections to each other unclear at this early stage, I didn't find the content overly complex or hard to follow.The acting was good - not excellent but easily of the standard required. The impression created is that this will improve as the series progresses. All in all this was an excellent opening episode and I look forward to more."
2,0,8,1,"The first episode of Game of Thrones opens in a suitably violent fashion. From there, we are quickly introduced to the main characters and the details of their relationships are sketched out. A lot of scenes are very short with us quickly going from one location to another, but there is a lot of ground that needs to be covered. The wonderful title sequence is a joy. Those who are fans of the books will find that much in this first episode follows the book quite closely, though there are some changes here and there. The introduction of the Starks is a very nicely done and the introduction of the Targaryen siblings is excellent. The scene with Tyrion Lannister and Jon Snow was my favourite scene of the episode. And, of course, the ending had me wanting to watch the next episode straight away! Prior to the last scene I thought, it had been OK and I would persevere with it, but the ending made me need I each it straight away."
3,0,8,1,"A solid and excellent start to probably the greatest show in modern times. I am grateful to be alive to watch this show and be among the many masses across the globe that love this watch. Game of Thrones wastes no time in creating its own universe and characters. It is as if it has always been and you the viewer just showed up to join the party. Some brutal scenes and rich dialogue let you know that this is a show like no other. After watching this series you will be awe stricken and ask Breaking what?? Clearly in today's times this show has no equal. So if you tuned in to this show and have started watching I have news for you, it just gets better and better. Also some advice, don't get attached to a character because in the Game of Thrones you win or you die."
4,0,10,1,I have been waiting 7 years to watch this series - I've finally acquired it and now enjoying it! This first episode blew me away and got me interested right away with the story and characters themselves. Everything about this premier episode is top notch! HIGHLY recommended viewing for those that had to wait to watch it (as I did) or for those wanting to watch again. House Stark for me! 10/10
5,0,8,1,"Reviews Of Unusual Size!Re: Based on the novels by George R.R. Martin, Game Of Thrones tells of a land of seven kingdoms, surrounded by intrigue, death, sex, family duty and what men and women are willing to do to sit on the iron throne. Outstanding: I loved the title sequence, I thought it was beautiful and clever. The casting in this is great, with a lot of small name (or no name) actors and everyone is very good. The settings and costumes are elaborate and realistic.Unacceptable: A few of the scenes in this episode felt poorly shot/acted, with lingering shots of characters doing something a bit awkwardly to drag out the dramatic tension. I have a hard time seeing them sandwich the entire book into a ten episode series without it feeling rushed.Summary: So far, a gallant effort by the filmmakers. The world of the seven kingdoms is beautiful and dangerous and the characters are right out of the books, with a lot of the dialogue true to the source material. I knew from the get go that I was going to be all about Peter Dinklage as the dwarf Tyrion and sure enough, he's spectacular, but I was very pleasantly surprised by how much I liked Joseph Mawle as Benjen. I've never seen him in anything else, but I really dig him. A promising start.4/5"
6,0,10,1,"This is my first time viewing Game of Thrones, so I am slightly aware of the main plot and some story lines, but really not enough to have predicted anything that was going to happen.It moves at a pretty quick pace, the plot development is easy to follow and I thought they established character development through various and dialogue from several different viewpoints, which helps make connection with the characters from early on. Plenty of shock that comes from the subplots that aren't over the top or too obnoxious for what has already been developed. A regular amount of nudity, and some strong language, although not too over the top by any means. Some graphic scenes.I would say that basing everything I've heard about the series off a 60 minutes episode, I look forward to moving along and I am curious to see where things go from here. 10/10, would recommend for a friend."
7,0,10,1,"This week I chose to watch Game of Thrones, Season 1, Episode 1 (2011). The genre is action, adventure, drama. The episode was 1:01:37 long. The logline reads ""Jon Arryn, the Hand of the King, is dead. King Robert Baratheon plans to ask his oldest friend, Eddard Stark, to take Jon's place. Across the sea, Viserys Targaryen plans to wed his sister to a nomadic warlord in exchange for an army."" The episode was engaging and made me feel excited to continue watching. I loved the casting of this show and the actors did amazing. The characters were interesting and provided a lot of show dynamic without sacrificing the storyline. I definitely see why this has made so many seasons. The pilot show did convince me to continue watch the show. I really had a hard time not binging as I remembered that I had a schedule to mind. All in all, I really liked this first episode and am disappointed in myself for not catching the GOT bug earlier."
8,0,10,1,"Came to 'Game of Thrones' fairly late in the game and due to being so busy the binge-watching was gradual. Have found myself truly loving the show, very quickly becoming one of my favourites. It totally lives up to the hype and not only does it do the brilliant source material justice (a rarity in television) it is on its own merits one of the finest, most addictive and consistently compelling shows in recent years and quality-wise it puts a lot of films in recent years to shame.""Winter is Coming"" starts off 'Game of Thrones' absolutely brilliantly, couldn't change anything for the world. Not many shows have their overall quality, tones, themes and characterisations so spot on and well-established when it first starts, but 'Game of Thrones' is one of the strongest exceptions. It is an example to all first/final episodes of how to start off a show.Visually, ""Winter is Coming"" looks amazing. The scenery is throughout spectacular, the sets are hugely atmospheric and beautiful on the eyes with a real meticulous eye for detail and the costumes suit the characters to a tee. The make-up is beautifully done. The visual effects are some of the best of any television programme and are not overused or abused, the scale, the detail and how they actually have character and soul are better than those in a lot of the big-budget blockbusters. As well the cinematography and editing, which are cinematic quality as well.One cannot talk about ""Winter is Coming"" without mentioning the thematically, orchestrally and atmospherically multi-layered music scoring and the unforgettable main theme. Again, worthy of a high-budget fantasy/action/drama film.It is hard not to be bowled over by the quality of the writing, outstanding isn't a strong enough adjective to describe how good the writing is. It always has a natural flow, is layered and thought-provoking and demonstrates a wide range of emotions such as suspenseful tension, poignant pathos and witty humour. The story is paced so beautifully, structured with such nuance and attention to coherence, a high emotional level and is done with intelligence and sensitivity.Not only are the more action-oriented/more dramatic moments done with a lot epic scale, superb staging, excitement and dramatic tension but underneath all the scale and flashy attention to detail there is a lot of heart and a multi-layered one.""Winter is Coming"" is so early on and already the characters are so well developed and as close to real life as one can get despite being in a fantasy world. These characters are not hero and villain archetypes and have both strengths and flaws and one can understand why they act the way they do.Sean Bean gives some of his best ever acting, as does Kit Harrington. Peter Dinklage has always been one of 'Game of Thrones's' greatest assets and that is totally the case here.All in all, couldn't have started such a wonderful show so perfectly. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
9,0,9,1,"Right from the start Game of Thrones is beautifully well made. As a viewer you would not necessarily know what is going on unless you had read the books but the quality of production is clear straight away. The filming is of very high standard, the sets, costumes, music etc are all spot on. Most of all it is the dialogue, acting and the plot which sets this show way above the normal standard of TV shows. The first episode begins with the quality already all there to see in all these respects.One negative of this first episode is that there perhaps could have been some clearer and more logical depiction of the passage of time. Dialogue explains a month has passed but this passage of time is unclear in its presentation. Some things seem to have needed a different passage of time. The direwolves found as tiny pups at the start remain very small right to the last scene before appearing as much larger animals at the start of episode 2 which is meant to be only a few weeks later. This is actually a 'fault' of the book 'A Game of Thrones', the first of author GRR Martin's great 'A Song of Ice and Fire' book series. The first book is very faithfully adapted in season 1 (apart from older ages for characters in the series than in the books) and I feel the passage of time could have actually been improved. Martin's book depicts each chapter from a different character's point of view. This is brilliant dramatically and artistically but it does not lend itself to neat chronological progress as things seem to progress at slightly different rates for different characters or at least the passage of weeks and months is not fully clear. For the series it would be better in my view if they showed the initial events of the prologue and the direwolf pups being found as happening around the same time before showing that many months have passed before Jon Arryn's death and initial events at Winterfell with the royal visit then shown to happen later having had time to travel up from King's Landing. That way the pups could have grown already in order that they can believably be normal wolf size (though not full grown direwolf yet) for episode 2 and it would have given a better feeling of time progressing from Jon Arryn's death to the royal visit.The only other issue is this episode understandably has to introduce a lot of characters, settings and set up the storyline so it is quite heavily laden to take in and fully enjoy when you first see it, unless you have read the first book. It is much more enjoyable re-watching it when you know how it all pans out.Those aspects means it is not one of the series best episodes but it is excellent in establishing the series roots. The settings and characters are presented very effectively and the story is quite absorbing by halfway through the episode.It is difficult to pick out any particular actor. The ensemble cast all deliver top performances. Sean Bean immediately makes Ned Stark a fully three dimensional character you are sympathising with and Kit Harrington as Jon Snow gets you on his side from the beginning too. Cersei and Viserys immediately make your skin crawl while Mark Addy and Peter Dinklage make you laugh as King Robert and Tyrion. I feel Tyrion is slightly less sympathetically presented in this episode than he is in the book but he goes on in later episodes to be presented more favourably.The differing ages of characters from the books to the series is quite a big difference. In the books Jon and Robb are 14, Dany is 13, Joffrey is 12, Sansa is 11, Bran is only 7 and Rickon is 3 whilst Ned, Robert, Cat, Cersei, Jaime and Tyrion are all only meant to be mid thirties at most! It is a 'double edged sword' because in some ways I think it would have been nice and made sense for the ages and timescales to be the same as in the book but it was much easier to present some of the events with older actors as the Stark children and they make it all work really well. I am happy we got the cast we did.The cliffhanger at the end of the episode is done to perfection and is the hook that grabs you. From that point I was on board 100% and could not wait for the second episode.8.5/10"
12,0,8,1,"The pilot episode is a good beginning to what many think is the greatest show made in our time. The episode introduces you to many of the characters in a good way, and it makes you want to know more about them, and their story. Even though a lot of dark thinks happens during the episode, they are also able to put some humour into all the darkness. The episode is well made, and it ends on a cliff-hanger that makes you want to watch more."
13,0,8,1,"Genre: fantasy and serial drama
Created by David Benioff and D. B. WeissIn this episode ""the winter is coming"", we meet the stark clan, the protectors of the North. The north is ruled by Eddard Stark and his family. One day the king, King Robert traveled 1 month to visit Eddard stark to ask Eddard Stark if he could help protect him after the death of the previous Hand of the king, but for him to do that he has to leave his family.One of the characters I really enjoyed was Arya Stark. She is the daughter of Eddard Stark. I liked her because she was tough, she was not afraid of being her self and she also was funny.I think this episode offered a balance of darkness, humor, drama and character-building. I think it was a little bit too long for my taste, but I still would recommend it😊 ."
14,0,8,1,"If you haven't heard about this exiting, fantasy filled drama, then you've been living under a rock. Already in the first episode they start off with a bang, with conflicts, murders, love affairs and so much more.
The Game of Thrones series is an American fantasy, drama made by David Benioff and D.B. Weiss. It's an adaption of a series of novels ""A Song of Ice and Fire,"" written by George R.R Martin. The series premiered on HBO in the United States on April 17. 2011, and will end with its eight season, which premiered om April 14. 2019.
In the very beginning, we get to know a real threat to the people, which the royals refuse to believe. Then we get to know the Lord and his family. The first kid we meet is the youngest son of the Lord, Brandon Stark, a young, ambitious and adventurous kid. Then we meet his brothers, and his parents. The Lord, Eddard Ned Stark, is a man who follows the law and the king but is a loyal friend. We also follow other characters story along the way, and it can be hard keeping up with all the stories.
However, my personal experience was that the episode left me feeling all sorts of emotions, fear, disgust, laughter and shock. I kept myself from watching Game of Thrones for so long now, because I knew that if I got into it, I would become addicted and watch 8 seasons in one go. To make it even worse, the episode ended with a cliffhanger which means I must watch the next episode as soon as possible. Therefore, I would recommend it to everyone who likes an exciting, fantasy, plotting drama."
15,0,9,1,"Wow! What a great beginning, I've choked when I've seen this world, winter is coming is one of the most popular episodes series."
16,0,10,1,"Cinéma has Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings, Now TV has the Game of Thrones by the master of Sandkings. George R. R. Martin in heaven his work should spawn at least Four Seasons, The cold-blooded beginning will burn your latent emotions and freeze your dual reasons.Closing black metal door and opening credits scavenging for unknown kingdoms, Highlander and fantastic territories as surreal as a wonderful forest of giant mushrooms. Almighty production with only a few minor glitches and heroic sets, From lifelike costumes and lurking soundtrack to majestic visual effects.Sean Bean as lead and Lena Headey as queen plunged in a pool of steep talent. Kids to glide a smile, the bastard and the dwarf, vertiginous curves with riding knights. A cascade of refreshing characters to escort us through black days and white nights. Cuddly wolves, history books, dragon eggs. A universe has never been so magnificent.Tolkienian by its numerous names and great attention to details, Despite the labyrinth an enchainting viewing and intriguing parallel stories. Winter warriors, white haired incest or blue savages are struggling families. A balance of Braveheart blood and medieval epicness to crimp biogenic trails."
17,0,10,1,Fantastic pilot to get to now the character and the story. Great start of what would become the greatest television show ever in the history of man kind. Wonderful cast. This is how it all began and it was great even at the start. This episode is fantastic like all of them. I can watch this episode over and over again and I will never get tired of it.
18,0,10,1,"Fantastic premier episode of an amazing show. The show is truly something else and this premier is were it all started. This episode introduced many characters and plot at once, which can be hard to keep up with. But once you get grip of the story and who every one is. It becomes just amazing hour of television.Great visuals as always from HBO and a great cast. The score is also fantastic. The premier has a great replay value as well. Even after being seasons ahead. You can just sit back and watch this episode and see how it all started. It takes you back. Just amazing."
19,0,9,1,"The plot is intentionally complex, too, while the scale of the production is astonishing: with its sumptuous scenery and nifty camerawork, Game of Thrones looks like a Hollywood movie."
20,1,9,1,"Dead or alive ? The question shameful viewers like me, because we haven't read the novel yet, had in their mind for a week after the pilot tragic events. It was answered right after the fantastic title sequence that smooths the immersion process dramatically. At the start your mind is still thinking about your day but once the episode begins it has entered a medieval realm one can only be reluctant to leave.Indeed all parallel stories have potential and despite their slow pace even an impatient wouldn't leave its seat for a second. Indeed on the Stark and Lannister side the boy's accident has unveiled the true nature of some characters like Cersei (Lena Headey), a Queen gnawed by anger, and Jaime (Nikolaj Coaster-Walday), the white knight a damsel in distress would regret to be rescued by. To tell the truth in Winter is Coming I had no idea they were related because I just couldn't keep up with all the names and locations. But when watching becomes nearly as demanding as reading then you know the adaptation was respectful of its source material. Still even if all these webby connections between players, because chess is a great metaphora of life, are exciting I hope their profiles are not as Manichaean as they seem. Hopefully we should know why some love while others hate. Otherwise I have no doubt about Arya Stark, the little girl vigorously played by Maisie Williams, and her mother Catelyn. Michelle Fairley revealed a palette of extreme emotions that forged her scenes like blades of steel. As for her daughter you really have to see her play with the gift one of her brothers offered her. If it had been Chucky it would have either fall in love with her or worry about its life because when Arya is angry, well she seems as dangerous as an innocent clown piranha about to have its midnight breakfast.Juggling is both an entertaining and interesting medieval craft but now the mysterious and worried Daenerys Targaryen has convinced me to throw dragon eggs in the mix. Emilia Clarke gave a seductive performance and I like the way her whiteness contrasts with her tribal husband. Harry Lloyd's appearances as her wicked brother Viserys are rare but percussive. Will he get his crown back ? Will she free herself from him ? In fact does she even want to ? There's almost something mystical about their story and I wonder if she has other resources to survive than her exquisite shapes. But between two shy glimpses at her royal hips I also strongly recommend the audience to pay attention to the dialogs because this time they were heavy on mythology. Where do the dragons come from ? What do the fields represent for the Dothraki people ? Similar questions could also be raised considering the Stark side as some friendly battle between the bastard and the dwarf occurred in the woods. It should even make you question what happened at the very beginning of the pilot even if I have no doubt about itOther gems include the Dothraki language, specially developed for the show – very Tolkienian, an almost sapphic kamasutra lesson – can't wait the next, and an ongoing investigation about the boy's fall. But this short list, compared to the installment diversity and greatness, would be even more incomplete if one word wasn't added : Wolf. Indeed the story was wild every which way. What a thrilling way to use these majestuous and savage hunters ! They actually reminded me of White Fang (Jack London) and I wonder how they see things from their point of view. Wouldn't it be dazzling to actually film a scene from there ? So let's hope the other directors and minds behind the show will surprise us with their creativity. All in all it was an other awards magnet and if the end doesn't electrify you well I don't know what will !"
21,1,8,1,"In Winterfell, Catelyn stays in Bran's room with her son that is in coma while Ned Stark travels with King Robert to King's landing. An assassin tries to kill Bran, but Catelyn protects him and Bran's wolf kills the man. Arya is playing with the butcher's boy nearby the river and Joffrey and Sansa meet them and Joffrey picks fight with the boy that does not react. Arya throws Joffrey's sword in the river and he attacks the girl but her wolf protects Arya. Daenerys has difficulties to sexually satisfy Khal Drogo and her slave teaches her how to please her man. Jon Snow travels with his uncle Benjen to The Wall to join the Night Watch. Catelyn investigates the location where Brans felt and she finds a hair. Meanwhile Bran awakes from his coma. ""The Kingsroad"" is the second episode of ""Game of Thrones"" and shows the injustice and how despicable the Lannisters are. The poor she-wolf is killed to satisfy the nasty Lannister family and Sansa felt the price of her attitude. The Starks are separated and Catelyn now knows that her son might have been thrown off the wall. Jon Snow now knows what The Wall is. What will Bran say if the climax of this good episode. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""The Kingsroad"""
22,1,9,1,"The second episode of Game of Thrones builds nicely on the excellent opening. Looking at it now it is moving to see characters saying farewells as they go on journeys from which we know some will not return for a long time, if ever. We see the Starks starting to split up to follow different paths with Jon Snow riding off to 'take the black' and Ned riding to King's Landing.Acting is brilliant across the whole cast and the very well written dialogue is intelligently supporting the intriguing plot. At this point the show is not quite up to top speed but is establishing itself with incredibly high standards.One grumble I have with the transition from episode 1 to this episode is that when Bran's direwolf Summer is shown, the animal is strikingly large when at the end of episode 1 it was still a very small pup. It is established that only a few weeks has passed between these two points so even for a fast growing direwolf in a fantasy setting it seems jarringly improbable that it could have grown so much in such a short time. An avoidable lapse in internal logic perhaps but not a major one and really that fault lies with the first episode not this episode. Within this episode there is no issue.On the plus side the plot moves on well increasing the level of interest for a new viewer. This episode also starts to establish Daenerys' character (Emilia Clarke) strongly with her showing some strength and drive. The star of this episode is probably Jack Gleeson's Joffrey though. His brilliantly slimy, cocky and nasty little turd of a Prince is wonderfully brought to the fore in a scene where Arya's direwolf bites him. This also leads to some moving scenes as well as letting Maisie Williams as Arya show that she too is a real little star. Mark Addy and Sean Bean play the father figures with aplomb and Lena Headey as Cersei is already a manipulative bitch Queen.9/10"
23,1,8,1,"Kit Harrington, Peter Dinklage, Maisie Williams, Sean Bean and Jack Gleason I salute you.In the second episode of Game Of Thrones, there is a bit more fleshing out of the characters but the pacing is still quite quick though. And whilst it was not as enjoyable as the first episode, it's still a good episode.On the whole, it's a pretty depressing episode, with most of the characters being very unhappy. There are a few scenes that I particularly liked, The first one featuring Jon Snow and Arya Stark. This episode is the first to really give Maisie Williams as Arya really decent scenes, and she does wonderfully, she is very cute and endearing in the scene with Jon, and then later she is brave and feisty during her confrontation with Prince Joffery. One with Tyrion and Jon en route to The Wall, and again one featuring Jon. This time with Caitelyn by Brandon's bedside. I do need to praise Michelle Fairley, because her acting in these scenes is very good. As he is pivotal to three of my favourite scenes I need to add Kit Harrington is doing an awesome job as the bastard Jon Snow. As is Peter Dinklage, he simply steals every scene that he is in.This is the first time, I have found myself liking a character played by Sean Bean. He is not someone whose work I have ever enjoyed, but his vulnerability as a noble Ned Stark who's prepared to do what he must (albeit with a heavy heart) is one I am particularly taken with. Jack Gleason deserves special praise too, as he simply makes you despise Prince Joffery. And the final moment? Once again I needed to watch the next episode straight away"
25,1,9,1,"""The Kingsroad"" is a particularly eventful hour of Game Of Thrones, layering on plot point after plot point in a brisk, fairly economical matter."
111,6,9,1,"This is the seventh episode of the first season of the Game of Thrones. It's a very good episode, and it one of the better episodes to have appear so far in the first season. The stakes are higher, the feelings are more emotional, and now we have Kings Landing in danger from an enemy across the seas. Also, stay tuned for a great ending. It's an ending that you may or may not have seen coming.In this episode, ""You Win or You Die,"" King Robert is back from the boar hunt, but he lays dying after a grave injury. Ned Stark confronts Cersei and tells her who her son really is. Jon Snow makes his Night Watch vows, despite feeling unhappy for his new role as steward and the disappearance of his Uncle Benji. Finally, after Vaenarys is nearly poisoned by a man sent by Robert, Drogo calls for war against King Robert.Overall, this is a great episode. It's one that kind of sad to for various reasons. Once again, we get fantastic acting all around. The final few episodes are going to be something to keep an eye on.My Grade: A"
56,3,10,1,"Once the ending credits roll you'll realize you're shaking. Fear ? Admiration ? Anger ? The wicked emotions this fourth episode should make you feel could be a first for your televisual experience. With the characters gradually growing on us their every scenes seem more authentic and pivotal. Since the pilot we know that everything can change in a few split seconds. One minute the little boy was climbing, the next he is a cripple. So Game of the Thrones play in the same league of masterpieces like Dexter and Lost, shows that have pushed the quality barrier far beyond its audience expectations. I'm talking about these memorable moments when you forget it's actually TV. And when it comes to convey such extreme after effects no one can deny that talents like Michael C. Hall, Jennifer Carpenter, Terry O'Quinn and Matthew Fox of course are the first names that pop up in your head as best examples. I should also mention Spartacus : Blood and Sand considering how much I praised the show and Andy Whitfield's performance but it wouldn't be reasonable. At least it's the trembling resonance the acting had on me this time.The first impact came from Emilia Clarke as Daenerys and Harry Lloyd as Viserys. The last bathtub sequence was surprising, sensual and more important very enlightening. Indeed it allowed us to learn more about the fantasy elements that populate the kingdoms, specially the legendary dragons, and unveiled the evil brother backstory. But it's really when he tried to dominate his sister again that you should feel the ground quaking beneath your seat. And don't get wrong, it's really happening. In your stars or in your skull, don't pretend you can resist her. The second impact would be what happened in the cold winter arc. Jon Snow's story is so dark and disturbing ! It's the perfect counter poison to the others even if I also expect storm and other destructive elements to unleash their fury on our friends and foes. The speech Snow and his new chubby buddy were given was horrific and even more frightening than the dark fairytale the creepy grandma told little Bran. Winter is Coming ? It seems even Ned could be underestimating what it really means. Last but not least the third impact, that also served as a cliffhanger, was definitely Catelyn Stark's escape at the inn. They couldn't have made a better choice than casting Michelle Fairley as Ned's wife. Like Sean Bean she had already impressed us but this installment you'll learn why people call her Lady Stark. It was pure grace and strength put into motion. It also revealed what really separates some Starks from some Lannisters, because they aren't all just black or white.Between two shakes there was still plenty of room for entertaining and interesting stuff. Arya's role was minor this time but her little chat with her father was refreshing and definitely intriguing. What a cute and fierce portrayal of the inevitable Joan of Arc she should become ! I don't know about her destiny considering I haven't read the novel yet but I can't see how she could restrain herself to just become a pretty queen. Once all grown up she could be to the show who Deedlit is to Record of Lodoss War, a beautiful and inspiring female warrior. An other element I quite enjoyed was Ned's lecture in the park about trust and issues. As for his dangerous mind game with Cersei Lannister, played by the delicate Lena Headey, my only complain would be about the lighting. In fact it's not the first time I have noticed the issue, that its whiteness is far too artificial. It's slightly disappointing because other than that the production is an immersion model and surely a delight for graphics whores and other amateurs of fine arts. And should I even mention the dreamy title sequence ? To conclude a mandatory sequence, when it comes to medieval fiction, was also featured and even if I found it a little rushed it was definitely exciting and was also the perfect occasion to learn more about an enigmatic character we knew nothing about until now."
58,3,10,1,"Fantastic episode. Amazing acting from Dinklage and the rest of the cast. Great pacing like always.The episode was well put together, from the composer, writers, director, crew and cast. You can see that every single one gave their all.The show only gets better and better after each episode."
87,5,8,1,"In this sixth episode we don't see the Wall for another episode. What we do get is we get another good scene with Robb Stark (Richard Madden) and Theon Greyjoy (Alfie Allen). And we finally see what Robb can do in combat. We also get to see Arya with her ""dancing master"" Syrio Forel again and she learns a valuable lesson. Maisie Williams and Miltos Yerolemou are, once again, fabulous together. Ser Jorah and Viserys share a good scene too and Viserys comes across, for just a moment, as sympathetic. Just for a moment. And we see Ned make a shocking discovery.My favourite scene of the season so far was Tyrions confession, who didn't want to know the end to Tyrion's story about taking a mule and a honeycomb into a brothel?? Tyrion played to perfection by Peter Dinklage and Arya played by Maisie Williams and dare I say it, noble Ned Stark played by Sean Bean (who I stated in an earlier review, I'm not a fan of him or any of his work) are easily my favourite characters so far. I need to give special mention to Jerome Flynn, who's character still does not have a name on the show (but IMDb says is Bronn) who I'm really enjoying too.One scene that puzzled me, was Joffrey's sudden apology to Sansa, 3 episodes after we saw Cersei advising her son to do just that. Why now?? We do get to see just how naive Sansa (Sophie Turner) is. Turner plays the scene very well going from being rude to her Septa Mordane (a superb Susan Brown) to smitten the minute Joffery arrives. All I can think of, is it tied to a scene following shortly where Eddard announced he was sending the girls back to Winterfell, and Sansa's pleas to stay, she may have been happy to leave had Joffery not apologised. There is a nice moment in that scene that is just a look between Sean Bean and Maisie Williams as Sansa says ""I don't want someone brave, handsome and strong... I want Joffery"" it really showed the chemistry between the two. Possibly the best episode so far!"
88,5,9,1,"King Robert reinstates Ned as the King's Hand and goes hunting. Ned is recovering his wound on the leg but is forced to take tough decisions against Gregor ""The Mountain"" Clegane in the name of the King. Tyrion demands a trial by combat and finds a knight to represent him. Viserys disrespects his sister Daenerys and Khal Drogo in front of their people demanding his golden crown and Drogo immediately resolves the situation.""A Golden Crown"" is another gripping episode of ""Game of Thrones"" with tough decisions take by Ned; the trial of Tyrion; and the coronation of the ambitious Viserys that finally receives a golden crown. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): ""A Golden Crown"""
89,5,9,1,"This is the sixth episode of the first season of Game of Thrones. It's a solid episode that has quite a bit happening for it. While the first half of the episode may be mostly talk and the struggles of trying to run a kingdom, the second half is spectacular on the action/drama front as we witness a sword duel and a brotherly hissy fit. The ending is fantastic, so hold on to your seats.In this episode, ""The Golden Crown,"" Ned reunites with King Robert as Robert leaves him in charge of the kingdom while he is off boar-hunting. Ned also sends Arya and Sansa back to Winterfell and in the process of doing so, he learns of a secret from John Arryn. Meanwhile, Tyrion requests a sword duel to seal his fate and Viserys is losing his patience with Drogo, whom Drogo has a surprise for.Overall, I this another solid entry in this entertaining first season of the hit fantasy series. The ending is just worth watching this episode for. Also, in part due to Drogo's customs, there are quite a few bloody scenes. So for those who have squeamish stomachs, you may want to not eat anything before watching this episode.My Grade: A"
90,5,10,1,I like the bit where that bloke fell out of the hole when he lost the fight

92,5,9,1,"From the interaction between Ned and the King to the trial of our diminutive friend in the castle, this is non-stop entertainment. There is more of the maneuvering for power. There are the barbarians who now have a queen who must show her resolve by eating the heart of a horse (yes, the whole thing). We see her brother invade a world where he is an alien but doesn't get it. Ned maintains his morality as his wife goes off, causing problems. We have his daughter, betrothed to the king, acting in her selfish, childish way. Bran almost gets it. Most of the children, including that awful suckling child, are really selfish and full of themselves. The Prince comes and makes peace with the daughter, but we must remember how hollow his offer is, how self serving. She, of course, is too dense to understand what is going on."
94,5,9,1,"A Golden Crown is another great episode that features non-stop entertainment. The interactions from the characters are great including Ned Stark and the King and the trial sequence is really interesting. Even the story arc for the Lannister family shines and the interactions between them (and sorry for forgetting to mention that name) are also interesting. My only quibble is that it did drag a bit long.Still, the acting's still great with the performances continuing to shine, the scenery remains gorgeous, the script is smart, the story is good, the dialog is fresh, and the music score continues to have an atmosphere. So, overall, another great episode. Thumbs up! :)"
95,5,8,1,"The previous installment Stark versus Lannister driven story was thrilling but it had a drawback. Indeed it revealed one flaw of the show, its editing. I just found the numerous switches between arcs a little annoying because the transitions weren't smooth enough. Compared to Lost's season 6 for example it lacked some creativity, original ideas to link them instead of sharp cuts. I love Arya and her dancing session in Lord Snow was fantastic but here it felt slightly misplaced or at least not well staged. It's probably the issue when dealing with so many parallel stories, they just can't be all properly covered in one single episode. In my opinion their mistake was to even tell the anecdotic ones like the prostitute flying away or the king hunting. Of course their purpose was to feed the more important ones but I can't help thinking that they should have better arranged them. Or maybe I was just disappointed that it wasn't a special Daenerys installment. I mean she's such a fascinating and ambivalent character ! The Queen of Dothraki literally stole the screen and her few scenes were both shocking and intriguing. One reference that stroke my mind ? Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom ! Yes because Lady Stark, her strange sister and the dwarf were back too. The dungeon is apparently full of surprises and as a roleplayer I'm already dreaming of giant dragons and wicked pitfalls ! If only the show's format was more elegant, like in Fringe's season 3 for instance. Still it didn't change the fact that most story arcs, because I was a bit disappointed by Ned's one, were excellent. As for the ending it confirmed again that Game of Thrones is not for the faint of heart. Long live the King !"
96,5,9,1,"Season 1, episode 6. I found a little slower than the first 5 BUT it's really good. We finally get to see the trial of Tyrion, Ned finds out more information on the Lannisters and of Jon Arryn's murder and Viserys' Golden Crown will leave you shocked!9.5/10"
97,5,10,1,"Following on from the exciting and shocking confrontation between Jaime and Ned at the end of the previous episode we begin this episode with Ned, injured and recovering in bed overlooked by King Robert and the vile Cersei. A really good scene between the three culminates in Robert demanding Ned continues as Hand of the King and takes care of matters while he goes on a hunt to 'clear his mind'. The drama is intense with Ned and Cersei at loggerheads, a wounded Ned making a big decision to clash with Tywin Lannister and his bannerman Gregor (The Mountain) Clegane and Robert's hunt bringing about a serious mishap that throws everything into chaos. Meanwhile Tyrion hilariously confronts Lysa Arryn and demands trial by combat in the Eyrie.Alongside all the Kings Landing events we also have things developing dramatically across the Narrow Sea with Dany, Viserys and Drogo which climaxes with a tremendous final scene that is thrilling and satisfyingly shocking. It features a silly aspect of gold appearing to melt very quickly in a hot cooking pot (which would not happen) but is acted out so thrillingly and has such an amazing visual moment of horror that I have to forgive the little 'mistake' of the too easily melting gold.This all brings a fantastic mixture of excitement, tension, intrigue and thrills with some great humour thrown in. As well as the amusement from Tyrion, we get a lovely funny scene with Sansa and Arya with Ned when Sansa talks of her love for Joffrey.The acting, dialogue and action are all top notch and it all looks a visual treat. There are so many nice scenes of dialogue, including a beautiful scene between Arya and the wonderful Syrio Forel. This aspect is far better in the series than in the books.This is a superb episode. 10/10."
98,5,8,1,"Recovering from his wounds, Ned Stark is reinstated as the Kings' Hand and temporarily fills in for The King while the latter is off hunting. Receiving word that a knight is making life miserable for farmers, he realizes who it probably is, and has that person stripped of all titles and privileges. Meanwhile, a frustrated Tyrion demands a ""trial by combat"", getting agitated over his ""living conditions"". Viserys is likewise getting tired of inaction from Khal Drogo, and makes a stand. Robb proves himself quite capable of combat when saving the life of Bran from some forest-dwelling rogues.All of these actors are just so damn good that they completely sell this material, especially when you have thespians like Harry Lloyd as Viserys that get the viewer all fired up about hating their character. Granted, locations such as ""The Wall"", and some of the characters, take a back seat this time around, but that is good as it gives more screen time to people like Robb. Adding to the entertainment value is the fact that Ned does some more reading, and comes to a realization regarding Jon Arryn.There is some very enjoyable visceral action as blood flows freely, and individuals receive some nasty comeuppance. (Viewers will love the resolution that takes place in the last few minutes of the episode.) Moreover, the sense of humour is most welcome, as Tyrion ""confesses"" to a series of ridiculous-sounding crimes.The talent in front of and behind the camera make 'Game of Thrones' a rousing brand of entertainment indeed.Eight out of 10."
99,5,8,1,"Exciting, funny, scary, (slightly) tragic... though it didn't feature every character,... it had a whole lot of them, and a whole lot of what's quickly made this one of the best hours on television."
100,5,10,1,"This might be the best episode of season one, with lots of drama and interesting twists in both Westeros and Essos. When I watched the series for the first time I was slightly underwhelmed by the very first episode, but after this episode, I was truly hooked."
101,5,10,1,"Came to 'Game of Thrones' fairly late in the game and due to being so busy the binge-watching was gradual. Have found myself truly loving the show, very quickly becoming one of my favourites. It totally lives up to the hype and not only does it do the brilliant source material justice (a rarity in television) it is on its own merits one of the finest, most addictive and consistently compelling shows in recent years and quality-wise it puts a lot of films in recent years to shame.'Game of Thrones' first season continues to keep going from strength to strength. There is not a bad episode for me in the first season and ""A Golden Crown"" is among its better ones. ""A Golden Crown"" is closer to the more focused and tightly paced sort of stories than to the quieter in action and more reflective ones, the latter's been actually very well on 'Game of Thrones' but the richer and more layered storytelling and characterisation do fare a little better for me.""A Golden Crown"" is particularly noteworthy for the parts dealing with the Dothraki and also the moral dilemma of the way of ruling and fighting for honour and justice. The episode is also worth seeing for the powerful ending alone. Note of warning, ""A Golden Crown"" is not for the easily squeamish, definitely watch it before eating anything.Visually, ""A Golden Crown"" looks amazing. The scenery is throughout spectacular, the sets are hugely atmospheric and beautiful on the eyes with a real meticulous eye for detail and the costumes suit the characters to a tee. The make-up is beautifully done. The visual effects are some of the best of any television programme and are not overused or abused, the scale, the detail and how they actually have character and soul are better than those in a lot of the big-budget blockbusters. As well the cinematography and editing, which are cinematic quality as well.One cannot talk about ""A Golden Crown"" without mentioning the thematically, orchestrally and atmospherically multi-layered music scoring and the unforgettable main theme. Again, worthy of a high-budget fantasy/action/drama film.It is hard not to be bowled over by the quality of the writing, outstanding isn't a strong enough adjective to describe how good the writing is once again. It always has a natural flow, is layered and thought-provoking and demonstrates a wide range of emotions such as suspenseful tension, poignant pathos and witty humour. The monologues, Peter Dinklage has a particularly great one, and exchanges all add hugely to the character development. The story is paced beautifully, structured with such nuance and attention to coherence, a high emotional level and is done with intelligence, passion and sensitivity.Helped by the superb character and multi-layered writing throughout, the acting is hard to find faults. Peter Dinklage and Sean Bean are as always marvellous. Harry Lloyd provides a masterclass in how to humanise a villain and do it superbly, while Emilia Clarke shows that the more her role further expands and gets more interesting the more maturity there is.In conclusion, another wonderful episode. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
102,5,10,1,"I can't believe we will bid farewell the best series in the history, I'm really sad and my heart is broken 💔
Thanks for everything it was an amazing days 👋🏻💔"
103,6,10,1,"Is Game of Thrones just an other Good versus Evil battle ? I doubt it because I don't think George R. R. Martin is that naive and titling his work A Song of Ice and Fire was just a way to appeal our Manichaean reptilian brain. After all there's a reason why J. R. R. Tolkien set his fantasy writings in Middle-earth. Smoking dragons wouldn't be able to burn villages if they weren't able to fly. That's for the air. Is there a common ground for all these families ? And what if the Gods were only toying their creation from deep down the sea ? Atlantis, Greek and Norse mythologies The perfect number for the most pivotal episode so far. Se7en wicked steps to lose it and feel alive : 1. Digest the recap to freshen up your dry memory and dive in the most wonderful opening of all title sequences. 2. Chop up an animal corpse from beginning to end in front of the camera and give a visceral lecture on family values to Jaime Lannister. 3. Let the Littlefinger talk while teaching an exotic prostitute how to please the curvy nature of a Caucasian beauty. 4. Alert Jon Snow, hint at a possible beginning of the end and unveil an intriguing destiny. Bonus : Dungeons & Dragons joke. 5. Forge A Golden Crown for Daenerys dear brother then melt Ned's fate in the most unpredictable shapes. 6. Learn Dothraki to make sure you understand what Khal Drogo says because Jason Momoa's performance was both gentle and furious ! The 7th is obvious, it's yours."
104,6,10,1,This is such a smart show. Great writing and acting.The score is great. So is the crew. This episode is really good at setting up the episodes to come later this season. It does it in a really good way. No wonder this show called the best show ever.10 out of 10. Just amazing.
105,6,9,1,"Ned is going to pay a price for the King's odd lack of foresight. He has been badly wounded by a wild boar he was hunting. He knows he has little time left. Two things come in to play in this episode. First of all, it is the king just signing a piece of paper giving Ned dominion over his kingdom until his son is of age. The other is a man, trying to poison the queen of the horse people. The first sets up Ned as a traitor, and the queen responds with a vengeance. The second incites Drogo to cross the water and gain control of the Seven Kingdoms. Before this, he was happy to maintain his own kingdom and stay put on one side of the water. Now he is a force to be reckoned with. More complications. Ned's daughters' lives become more complicated. The one who would be queen is now seen as a traitor's daughter. The little one gets her first taste of blood. The last we see, her ""dancing instructor"" (teacher of swordsmanship) stands with a wooden stump to face a knight with a sword. She rushes away at his advising.. Things are now split wide open, with Ned no longer useful to the monarchy."
106,6,9,1,"Season 1, episode 7. This one left me feeling sick - I guessed Petyr ""Littlefinger"" Baelish was a snake... and my guess was right. Cersei and Joffrey are making me more angry - I can't stand either one of them. Daenerys and Khal's marriage they seem closer than ever - and at this point in the series I still don't trust nor like either one of them. Jon Snow and his friend Sam - I fear for both of them. There are snakes everywhere and this episode pulls them out of the wood-works.9.5/10"
107,6,10,1,I hate that little finger bloke. He is the biggest jerk in the entire show
108,6,10,1,"The many threads of this wonderful story are all developing beautifully and this episode ramps things up to the highest level. With the different locations, all with very different visuals and different feel this adds so much rich quality to the viewing experience.At the wall Jon is faced with his Uncle Benjen's horse returning without him making Benjen's survival even more in doubt. Jon also learns he is not going to be made a Ranger but be appointed as steward to Lord Mormont. He also is aware of dangers facing his family in the South. Amongst this he has to decide to make his vows and become a sworn brother of the Night's Watch. Most people would probably, logically ride back to Winterfell but the honorable, dutiful Jon with his doubts about his place in the world makes the choice to take his vows. A key decision that will be called into question very quickly. All the acting of Kit Harington, James Cosmo, Peter Vaughan, Owen Teale and John Bradley is great providing depth to Jon, Mormont, Maester Aemon, Alliser Thorne and Samwell Tarly delivering dialogue and expressions that make every scene work perfectly.An attempt is made on Dany's life which causes Drogo to make a powerful move towards war. This exciting development brings a great piece of dialogue from the book to life brilliantly. The speech from Drogo is magnificently delivered by Jason Momoa. Emilia Clarke and Iain Glen continue to act with grace and subtlety as Dany and Jorah.Tywin Lannister makes his entrance as a character in a brilliant scene with his son Jaime. Charles Dance is simply perfect as Tywin and immediately imbues the character with such class and power that is magical to watch. Nikolai Coster-Waldau ad Jaime plays his part brilliantly too showing some background to Jaime's motivations and inner conflict.King Robert (Mark Addy) sustains a serious injury on a hunt throwing the political struggles in King's Landing into a drastic situation requiring pivotal decisions. Ned (Sean Bean) has a great scene with Cersei (Lena Headey), again wonderfully brought to life from the book, where he warns her of his intentions. His honour overriding any clever manouvres. With Robert's injury Ned is named Lord Protector but must face the calculating Cersei and vile Joffrey, impressively played by Jack Gleeson. All the acting of these scenes is amazing and the scene in the throne room with Ned hoping to gain support from Ser Barristan, Littlefinger and the City watch against Cersei, Joffrey and the Kingsguard. Electrifying and hugely dramatic.This is a truly great episode which sets the series alight and starts to make a claim to be one of the finest (possibly the finest) shows of the last 30 years. 10/10."
86,4,9,1,"Season 1, episode 5. Excellent episode! In the end I was left very angry at Jamie yet I felt his pain wanting his brother Tyrion back - all over Ned Stark's son Bran. Ned leaving Robert's side over Daenerys and Khal's marriage and baby. But I dare not say more because I dislike giving away spoilers.9.5/10"
57,3,9,1,"This is the fourth episode of the first season of Game of Thrones. It is another great episode and it has a spectacular ending involving Tyrion Lannister and Lady Catelyn. The show moves along at its own pace and it can drag at times, but this episode is mainly politics and an investigation of some sort. We need to understand the background story before we can delve deep into the action.In this episode, ""Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things,"" Ned begins his investigation of Jon Arryn's death and he learns some interesting things about Jon. Jon Snow befriends a bumbling man named Sam who is forced to join the Night Watch. Sansa refuses to speak to her father and Arya begins her sword lessons. Overseas, Daenarys shows her brother she can also exercise some authority.Overall, this is a really good episode. It may be light on the action, but the tension and intrigue remains very high. I loved the ending and I wonder how they will move forward from here on out.My Grade: A"
85,4,9,1,"The fifth episode of Game of Throne's first season may be my favorite one yet! The tension is mounting thanks to the sharp script, exhilarating action sequences, great direction from Brian Kirk, and fantastic acting all-around (with Sean Bean and Mark Addy sharing the MVP award for the episode). The episode really kicks it into high-gear and there were some choices that surprised me considering this is only the fifth episode. For example, I did not expect Ned Stark to step down from his Hand of the King role so soon. I was expecting some kind of action in this regard later in the season, but not too soon. Mark Addy has some fantastic monologues, one with Ned and one with his wife, Cersei. Both monologues show just how vulnerable the king's character is. I was most interested in his conversation with Cersei. They admitted their hate....and their love to each other that lasted for seventeen years. In an episode with rising tension and an incredible battle sequence, these lines of dialogue stand out to me.In this episode ""The Wolf and the Lion,"" King Robert gathers his advisors and tells them of his plan to kill Daenary because he believes she will take the Dothraki horde and take them across the Narrow Sea to invade King's Landing. Ned refuses to comply, which creates a heated argument between the two friends, and it ends with Ned stepping down. As Ned is about to leave the capital, he finds a clue in regard to the death of the prior Hand with Robert's illegitimate son. Meanwhile, Arya overhears a plot against her father. Catelyn, who kidnapped Tyrion last episode, takes him as prisoner for her older sister, widow of the previous Hand, and leader of the Vale, Lysa Arryn. With news of Tyrion's kidnapping reaching King's Landing, Jaime Lannister confronts Ned Stark as he is about to leave.The acting is tremendous across the board. I already mentioned how great Mark Addy was, but Sean Bean deserves lots of credit. He makes his point about murdering a mother with an unborn child as immoral. I really liked his bold move quitting his position. This episode allows us to see the views from both sides and allows us to be sympathetic to both sides. I also love Tyrion's arc here, and I love how his sardonic personality is on display despite his unfortunate kidnapping.Another new kingdom was introduced to us here, and that was the Vale. The fortress is impenetrable, and it has a cool-looking prison on a ledge, but its ruler, Lysa (played by Kate Dickey) is crazy! Maybe I am being too kind calling her crazy. The episode introduces her to the viewers by breast-feeding her six-year-old son, Robyn. Apparently, Catelyn and Lisa haven't seen each other in five years....and that is pretty obvious in their meeting. Their sequences are short, but it's well-worth it. I think Robyn was annoying, but one can forgive thanks to the actions of the mother.Overall, this is a fantastic episode. I loved all this political dueling, in a sense. Robert, Cersei, Ned, Baelish, Varys, Catelyn, Robert's brother, Renly all have different kinds of political motivation. Their interactions with each other is the main reason why this episode is so tense and works so well. The monologue between Varys and Baelish is also worth a mention as we see they may have a plan about King Robert. Also, the humorous wordplay between Tyrion and sell-sword Bronn are well worth watching. Bronn will be a pivotal character in episodes to come. There is some gay representation here , thanks to Renly and the king's servant, Lancel. Lancel is someone the king is not entirely fond of as we see when from some of the dialogue. Also, I will mention the end battle between Ned and Jaime. That was some fancy sword work in action, plus a wonderful cliffhanger ending! Another episode, another win!My Grade: A"
83,4,9,1,"Things are coming to a boil. While it's a bit hard to figure everyone's motives, we do have a group of adversaries. The expediency comes in trying to outwit not just your obvious enemies but, in some cases, those that are superficially loyal. The Hand, Lord Stark, is trying hard to be loyal to friend and kind. The king wants to have absolute power but is a fat lazy slob who is only good at shouting orders. His ""marriage"" is just that and there is no love involved at all. Tyrion is with Lady Stark who believes that he is responsible for the near death of Bran. She takes him to her wacko sister after he saves her life in a battle. He is left on a precipice/prison cell with few options. The king orders Lord Stark to murder the sister and brother who are riding with the barbarians. He assumes they will ultimately ride against the king whose soldiers have grown soft and displaced. Lots to think about going into the sixth episode."
59,3,10,1,I like the bit where Jon Snow said that he builds his own fires
60,3,9,1,"1st season, 4th episode. Wonderful - highly interesting. The puzzle pieces are being set in place - some things are being cleared up or almost cleared up by the end of this one. I've already picked my favorite characters, I've picked my most hated characters and there are only a handful left that I'm unsure about. Some great scenes between the brother and sister: Daenerys & Viserys Targaryen. I'm glad to see Daenerys finally stand up to Viserys - but I'm still unsure what to make of Daenerys.Loving Jon Snow more and more with each episode - and his new friend Sam. My heart still goes out to The Starks over what Cersei & Jamie Lannister did to Bran. And I hate that Tyrion is being blamed - but should be cleared up by the next episode.9.5/10"
63,3,9,1,"This fourth episode is another worthy episode in the early goings of Game of Thrones. It is an episode mainly filled with exposition and stories, and that is what intrigued me. Many episodes that has nothing but stories tend to get crushed under such weight, but not here. Each actor is capable of telling these history-based stories in their own way. The history is fiction of course, but I couldn't have been more enthralled listening about how past events shaped the current world of Westeros. I am sure some people may be bored, but I can promise that learning about dragons or hearing stories about cannibalism is far from boring. Such stories have a poetic feel to them. For example, let's talk about Visery's dialogue. He was telling his lady friend, Doreah about how his father made him memorize the names of the old dragons and would give him sweets if he memorized them.If anything, the plot is advanced forward even more regarding the Starks. Ned continues his research, amongst a bunch of old books and genealogies, into what may have caused Jon Arryn's death. Despite that, he is still pressured with the politics of Westeros. When he could be doing his research, King Robert has him figuring out security for a pointless jousting match. Ned has to know that everyone has eyes on him tracking his every move. In a lovely conversation with Littlefinger, he tells Ned that he should trust no one and he points out the spies from the likes of himself, Varys (known as the Spider), and Cersei.The scenes with Arya are becoming more impressive by the episode. Maisie Williams is an incredibly gifted actress. She has a scene with Ned where she asks if Bran will be okay and he responds that he will be a lord one day and so will she. She tells him that is not her life. This series resembles the Middle Ages and women don't have much say about who they are. Either you can be a whore or a lady, not much in between. So I love how Arya know what she wants. She continues her sword training and these scenes are still delightful. Apparently, she will be chasing cats because they are nimble creatures! As for Sansa, she is still angry with Ned because of the direwolf incident. She does have an interesting conversation with Baelish when he tells her a story about Sandor 'The Hound"" Clegane and how he received his atrocious scars as a child from the hands of his older brother.Let's go to the North and check in with Jon Snow. He is partnered with the fat, bumbling Samwell Tarly (played by John Bradley). The stories atop the Wall are strong. Tarly has not fought a day in his life and he is only here because his father forced him to dress in black or he would be killed. Then of course while conversing, Ser Allister comes to them and mentions a story about how cold it is in the North during Winter and what they had to do to survive. Frightening stuff to hear, although Allister told his story out of spite. I love how Jon takes the mantle of doing the right thing and how he uses his direwolf to threaten anyone who makes fun of Sam.Finally, we go across the Narrow Sea. We see better what drives Viserys although his villain portrayal is still ""mustache-twirling"" to coin a phrase. But now he and the audience see that Daenarys is in charge and she knows it. I loved her threat about if he touches her again, he will have no hands. You go, Daenarys!Overall, this is an episode mainly filled with exposition. The series prides itself on its history so we learn new history stuff all the time, which is fine by me although it can be quite the dangerous game to play. Aiden Gillen is fantastic and quite funny. And of course Peter Dinklage. His character takes somewhat of a backseat, but he has some good lines regarding a saddle for Bran and insulting Theon Greyjoy. He is also involved in the cliffhanger, so be prepared! This episode is quite fun and thrilling!My Grade: A"
64,3,8,1,"This fourth episode of the popular TV series exists mainly to further explore characters and their relationships. Story threads include Ned's investigation into the death of Jon Arryn, whom he discovers was perusing a rather boring volume. A self-confessed coward, Samwell Tarly (John Bradley), experiences a rough training as he prepares for the Nights' Watch, and Jon Snow decides to protect him. Viserys raises his hand to his sister, and she vows that he'll lose both his hands if he ever does so again. And Tyrion makes the kind gesture of arranging for a special saddle to be made so that Bran can once again ride a horse.Once again, this capable cast and crew excel at world-building, and creating vivid, memorable characters. The actors simply couldn't be better, with standout monologues for the likes of Aidan Gillen (a.k.a. Baelish) and Owen Teale (a.k.a. Alliser Thorne). It's especially riveting the way that female characters such as Daenerys and Catelyn resolve on a firm course of action. The antagonists are great malevolent fun as always; Viserys is such an arrogant little p.o.s. as to have viewers eager for his eventual comeuppance.Most interesting to this viewer was much talk, in one key scene, of those magnificent flying dragons that have been discussed but not yet seen at this point in the series.Eight out of 10."
65,3,9,1,"The plot thickens, and even more characters are introduced - some that will follow us to the end of the series, some that have a briefer life span in the series. We also get some nice foreshadowing of things to come (although years from now). The series is starting to find its true shape."
66,3,8,1,"Production value is going to continue to be a struggle for the series, especially as we get to armies clashing, but as long as the character work remains as strong as this episode, I won't complain too much."
68,3,10,1,"Came to 'Game of Thrones' fairly late in the game and due to being so busy the binge-watching was gradual.

It totally lives up to the hype and not only does it do the brilliant source material justice (a rarity in television) it is on its own merits one of the finest, most addictive and consistently compelling shows in recent years and quality-wise it puts a lot of films in recent years to shame.Would like to call Season 1's fourth episode by its title, but due to it containing a prohibited word in the review guidelines (from my understanding) have decided not to in fear of guidelines violation. None of the episodes up to this point have disappointed, and this episode is not an exception. That it is very exposition-heavy and quieter in action could have easily crippled it, heavy exposition is not always kind to film and television, but this is a case of it benefiting from the exposition which does a fantastic job with developing the characters, their motivations and their backgrounds.It also doesn't suffer from trying to having too many characters and stories to introduce, ""Lord Snow"" did suffer a little from this but still managed to be a great episode because the characterisation and storytelling were still so superbly done. Not many shows have their overall quality, tones, themes and characterisations so spot on and well-established when it first starts, but 'Game of Thrones' is one of the strongest exceptions. The slower, more reflective and loose feel to the storytelling was appreciated and actually was appropriate considering the character and story density.Visually, it looks amazing. The scenery is throughout spectacular, the sets are hugely atmospheric and beautiful on the eyes with a real meticulous eye for detail and the costumes suit the characters to a tee.

Particularly good elsewhere are Michelle Fairley giving some of her career's best acting in her closing scene and the great addition of John Bradley.Overall, another wonderful episode. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
69,3,10,1,"This episode is not as bad, as what you're hearing and/or reading. Certainly, this fourth episode of the final season is not as action packed or as intense as one would think, considering how close we are to the end. However, there is essential information and disputes that arise, within this showing, that will force our characters to face these matters. Finally, I'm not one to typically rate an episode a 10, but I truly feel as though this episode does a terrific job at laying the foundation for our end, that is to come. (As a GoT fan, I don't understand how some viewers can judge so harshly, when the show's creators have done an excellent job, thus far.)"

depicts.Singing high praises for literally everything else and then giving low rating just because of violence .This is an a different word which is heavily based on the medieval times and it maybe had even more violence than the TV show .2.One who is complaining about season 8.
This is an episode from Season 1 which had a great writing and this is one of the best episodes of season 1 and GOT.Do not rate it low just because you did not like season 8.Go to s8 episodes and rate them low.Nothing could be more irrelevant."
72,4,9,1,"Tyrion discovers that Catelyn is actually bringing him to the Vale of Arryn, and not to Winterfell as she said, to mislead the Lannister and to meet her sister Lysa. However the group is attacked by a hill tribe and Tyrion protects Catelyn. Meanwhile Ned discovers dangerous secrets in King's Landing and Arya overhears two men in the dungeons plotting a war and the assassination of her father. There is a meeting of King Robert and the small council and the king orders Ned to kill Daenerys, her unborn son and Viserys, but he replies that this would be a dishonorable assignment and resigns to his position of King's Hand. He goes to a Littlefinger's brothel and finds a bastard son of Robert. When he leaves the place, Jaime is waiting for him with a little army because he heard about the imprisonment of Tyrion. They slaughter Ned's guards and Ned is stabbed on the back on his leg. ""The Wolf and the Lion"" is an episode full of action and intrigues in King's Landing. Ned learns how dangerous is the King's Hand position and for the first time he confronts the Machiavellian Robert. The cunning Tyrion will certainly find a way to revert his situation. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): ""The Wolf and the Lion"""
73,4,10,1,"After what I considered to be a ponderous episode 4, I find that it was all a build up to an incredible payoff in an amazing episode 5. Incredible performances, showdowns, and cliffhangers are everywhere.Sean Bean and Mark Addy require special mention for their scenes together in this episode, their first together since episode 2 (and one realizes that episode 3 and 4 were weaker for the lack of them). Excellent performers on their own, together they achieve an incredible dramatic synergy.Lena Headey and Mark Addy also require special mention for their scene together in this episode. Very telling and frank.Last but not least, if you are squeamish about sex, nudity, violence, or blood...this is not the series for you, and definitely not this episode. :)"
74,4,9,1,"This is the fifth episode of the first season of Game of Thrones. It is a rage-filled, emotional-heavy episode that features fine acting and a great ending. I was slightly disappointed we do not see Daenerys or the Dothrackis in this episode, although they are used in context. I liked this episode because you can see the rivalry between the Stark and the Lannister family as they are always in each others throat as they try to be the number one family in the kingdom.In this episode, ""The Wolf and the Lion,"" King Robert learns that the Dothrakis are going to bring war to the kingdom, so he plans to murder Vaenerys. Ned Stark brings the anger out of the king when he refuses. Arya overhears of a plot against her father. As Ned leaves Kings Landing, he runs into some trouble. Meanwhile, Catelyn Stark brings her prisoner, Tyrion to her sister's keep, where she happens to be the widow of Jon Arryn.Overall, this is another solid early entry in the Game of Thrones catalog. I really enjoyed the episode, particularly the rivalry between the Lannisters and the Starks which culminates in an epic sword battle towards the end. I did find the little kid who played the son of Catelyn's sister quite annoying, but other than that the acting was really good.My Grade: A-"
75,4,8,1,"With this episode, we hit the halfway point of the first season. We get more new characters and a new location. As a result, we do not see either the Dothraki or the Wall in this episode.We get a good scene between Ned and Ser Barrister Selmy (Ian McElhinney) Tyrion and a nameless character played by Jerome Flynn (yes him from Robson & Jerome) enjoy some post battle banter, the high point of the episode is a spectacular confrontation between The Hound and his brother The Mountain. There is a brilliant exchange between Varys and Littlefinger too, an then of course we have the ending. Another great ending. This is an episode that really shows Sean Bean's gift both for the physical side of acting and the emotional side. His Eddard carrying the weight of his disappointments and his honour to do his duty on his shoulders.Then there is his fight against Jaime Lannister. I need to praise Bean and Coaster-Waldau for their performance here; Coaster-Waldau especially carries off Jaime's cockiness and his rage when a fair single combat is disrupted. But Mark Addy? I've not been a fan of him in this show, however there is Brilliant acting on his part. Especially his rage at Ned."
76,4,10,1,"This one was really good, i mean really good. It had everything you want from an episode and then some. What more could you ask for.The cast is so talented. Every single one. Also the people who work behind the spotlight. The writers and directors and make up artists and so on.10 out of 10. Fantastic episode, this show just gets better after each episode. It really does. HBO is the best."
77,4,10,1,"Came to 'Game of Thrones' fairly late in the game and due to being so busy the binge-watching was gradual. Have found myself truly loving the show, very quickly becoming one of my favourites. It totally lives up to the hype and not only does it do the brilliant source material justice (a rarity in television) it is on its own merits one of the finest, most addictive and consistently compelling shows in recent years and quality-wise it puts a lot of films in recent years to shame.""The Wolf and the Lion"" is one of the best episodes of the first season, is classic 'Game of Thrones' and there is the agreement that it is the best episode since ""Winter is Coming"". Actually loved the quieter and heavier in exposition episodes in between, but things feel more focused and tighter here and things are more action-packed in a way that's exciting and intriguing and there is also plenty of character development that is rich and layered, Sean Bean and Mark Addy's scenes are particularly note-worthy.It has been commented by critics that the omission of the Night Watch and Dothraki scenes was a good move that made the story more focused and succinct and that the changes from the source material, mainly additions, were bold and made things feel more rounded. Have to completely agree with this. As well as some of the most exciting action scenes and best effects and visuals of the whole show, it was those aspects that were particularly striking about ""The Wolf and the Lion"". The dragon skulls and the Eyrie were standouts.Visually, ""The Wolf and the Lion"" looks amazing. The scenery is throughout spectacular, the sets are hugely atmospheric and beautiful on the eyes with a real meticulous eye for detail and the costumes suit the characters to a tee. The make-up is beautifully done. The visual effects are some of the best of any television programme and are not overused or abused, the scale, the detail and how they actually have character and soul are better than those in a lot of the big-budget blockbusters. As well the cinematography and editing, which are cinematic quality as well.One cannot talk about the episode without mentioning the thematically, orchestrally and atmospherically multi-layered music scoring and the unforgettable main theme. Again, worthy of a high-budget fantasy/action/drama film.It is hard not to be bowled over by the quality of the writing, outstanding isn't a strong enough adjective to describe how good the writing is once again. It always has a natural flow, is layered and thought-provoking and demonstrates a wide range of emotions such as suspenseful tension, poignant pathos and witty humour. The monologues and exchanges all add hugely to the character development. The story is paced beautifully, structured with such nuance and attention to coherence, a high emotional level and is done with intelligence, passion and sensitivity.Helped by the superb character and multi-layered writing throughout, although the acting is uniformly good across the board Sean Bean, Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau and Mark Addy are knockouts.Overall, phenomenal and what 'Game of Thrones' is all about. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
78,4,8,1,"With ""The Wolf and the Lion,"" the strongest episode of the season yet, Thrones has put its pieces in place and is ready to start putting them into motion."
79,4,9,1,"The Wolf and the Lion is perfect episode and improves over episode 3 and 4. It brings some more character development to not only the Stark family, but the other characters as well while having some very neat action sequences. And that's a good thing since it has a nice balance between character study and action. My only quibble is that it left me wanting to see more of how Tyrion will handle his predicament when he got arrested for his rumored crimes against Bran Stark.Everything else is done well. The acting continues to shine from all of the actors' performances especially Eddard who has a sense of humanity to him under his smug face when he chose not to kill Daenerys. The story is well-written, the script is smart, the dialog is excellent, the music score is still amazing, and it has a much fine pacing this time around.Overall, great episode and a great improvement."
80,4,10,1,I like all the brutal sword fights and the wild parties
81,4,8,1,"More intrigue, effectively nasty violence, and blatant sexual elements add to the mix in this typically zesty episode. Ned Stark is taken aback at his Kings' reaction to the news of Daenerys' pregnancy; the King now wants her and her offspring dead. A disgusted Ned then resigns from his position as Kings' Hand. Meanwhile, Catelyn takes her prisoner Tyrion to her sister Lysa (Kate Dickie) for punishment, only to receive a stern rebuke. Finally, an incensed Jaime confronts Ned about Tyrions' predicament, leading to an ugly scene indeed.'The Wolf and the Lion' is typically compelling entertainment, done with style and also a large amount of wit. This episode can be quite amusing at times. It also carries some real weight in the dialogue-heavy scenes between characters, such as a moment with the King and Cersei Lannister.This viewer is not one to complain about the level of brutality; rather, he feels that it adds an incredible visceral quality. It may be disturbing to more squeamish viewers, but it adds to the overall impact of the storytelling. It helps to create this idea of a world that is harsh and uncompromising.As for those sexual elements, well, none are more twisted than our introduction to Lysa; if anybody reading this is familiar with the trashy 1981 Italian zombie film ""Burial Ground"", they may experience a feeling of deja vu.This viewer may be late to the party in terms of checking out this series, but so far he's enjoyed what he's seen.Eight out of 10."
82,4,8,1,"This episode everything comes full swing and crazy stuff starts happening. All of the previous building up has not necessarily made this episode better than the previous ones, but more enjoyable than the previous ones on a first time watch."
84,4,10,1,If you have finished the series and wondered part of the significance of a particular character's parentage... this is part of it. We wouldn't have even had a story if it weren't for a certain member of the council having a little soft spot for Daenerys. The final season gives so much weight to some specific issues in the first season. I love being immersed into this world all over again.
227,15,9,1,"This a great episode: Now things are starting to get really interesting. By the way, an inconspicuous letter serves as a first introduction to a very brutal storyline (in later seasons)."

It is a quite different episode and there are many deviations from the book. The heart of the book is still kept, and while the book is just great in its own way the changes here in the episodes were not for the worse. ""The Old Gods and the New"" is a tightly paced, rich in story, development and characterisation, thrilling and emotional episode.There is a huge amount going on in the storytelling and the characterisation and how they're developed. The good news is that, like with ""Garden of Bones"", all interesting and important, nothing is superfluous here. The scenes between Tywin and Arya, the King's Landing Riot and the scene between Tyrion and Joffrey (as chillingly evil as ever) are particularly brilliantly executed scenes.Visually, ""The Old Gods and the New"" looks amazing.

Peter Dinklage continues to show why he is a fan favourite, Jack Gleeson sends chills up the scenes and Charles Dance and Maisie Williams act and interact beautifully in their scenes. Concluding, a 'Game of Thrones' high point. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
229,15,9,1,"This show has been as compelling as ever right out of the gate and has never flagged. With this many plot elements spinning around, there's just always much more to look forward to every week."
368,26,9,1,"What the hell is happening? This show used to be fast paced, interesting, brutal, clever, creepy.. now it's just boring talk. Everyone just.. TALKS.. a LOT.. This episode, thanks to its ending, was kind of more dynamic compared to the last 2 or 3 ones, and yet it's pretty much just dialogs everywhere, and not any kind of dialogs, no.. these are boring, pointless and clever-wanna-be dialogs. Season 3 is just pathetic compared to the first two amazing seasons. The only interesting characters are Tyrion, Dany and Jaime, and we only see them for a couple of minutes per episode. I would love to keep liking this show but I think that after season 3 I'm done with it (because I hate how they keep the action and interesting parts for the last 1 or 2 episodes, and then it just starts boring and slow again and again and again.. pure disappointment. This show is sadly turning into the perfect sleeping pill, people. Oh, and I repeat, this episode is WAY better than the last ones, but it's still plain boring."

372,27,10,1,"I'm repeating myself, but this is great story telling. Oh, and we get to hear the story of The Rains of Castamere. We've heard the songs a couple of times already in the series, and now we get to hear what it's all about."
373,27,9,1,"Second Sons is another well-written episode and sets up the last two episodes nicely. Yes, some of the dialog and pacing could've been a bit better, but at least it still maintain the strengths by the previous two seasons.The storyline/script is still compelling, the performances are still great, the relationships still shines, the directing is really focused well, the editing is still sharp, the scenery is still gorgeous, and Ramin Djawadi continues to compose some beautiful moments in his score.

It sets up the following episodes very well with a huge amount to recommend. Some meandering pacing is the sole drawback from personal opinion to a great episode that is a long way from second rate. The scenes between Tyrion and Sansa, both humorous and intense, and Ser Davos and Stannis are particularly strong in the character interaction, but the highlight of the episode is the electrifying ending, one of the season's best bar none.

375,27,10,1,Another exciting episode with lots of action and a great story
376,27,8,1,"Among many smallest segments, the highlights boil down in three meaningful happenings, the first the wedding day of Tyron and Sansa where the groom is extremely upset from father's order and makes a point to display his distaste on excess of wine, staying in the grip of the nasty humor of the spoiled and overbearing Joffrey, in return of such outrage Tyron replays pointing Joffrey's weak point, his dubious manhood, abased Joffrey reacts screaming louder, so Tywin intervenes appeasing the tempers, at wedding night behind the door is blatant the nuisance of both, Sansa is about undressing, however Tyron in clear proof of dignity is waiting for Sansa's consent, even if it takes forevermore.Meanwhile Daenerys shall assess the arrival of the mercenary army led by three commanders self-called Second Sons to strengthen Yunkay's defense, the wise girl demands an appointment at her tent in order to overturn their previous decision, in a nasty parlance what appears to be the command-in-chef spoke first and asking straight, how much she would offer to them changing the side, Daenerys has to swallow many obscene propositions and also a high power to convince those crude warriors, later they allotting between them who'll kill Daenerys.Perhaps the best is the remainder segment where Sam and Gilly carrying the baby towards to Castle Black at spooky forest they looking for a shelter due a looming stormy weather is coming, luckily the couple finds a rustic woodshed, meanwhile a heat discussion the name of the baby, surround by noisy crows sudden appears the ghost White Walker to get the liitle one and under a heavy snowfall, Sam has his finest hour, what a great and haunted finale!!Thanks for reading.Resume:

377,27,8,1,"""Second Sons"" was a really strong episode that had the good sense to leave out Jaime, Robb, Jon Snow and Theon in order to spend more time with three great stories - with three amazing (and different) intimate bedroom scenes."
378,27,10,1,"Season 3, episode 8. Daenerys gets the Second Sons to help her fight against Yunkai. Stannis releases Davos from the dungeons while The Red Woman conducts blood magic on Gendry - Stannis names the names of the people he wants dead. The Hound is taking Arya to her mother and brother Robb - hopefully in time for her uncle's wedding to one of the Freys. Sam and Gilly are making their way from her father with her son when they are attacked by a White Walker. Tyrion marries Sansa and Tywin orders the marriage consummated.10/10"
379,27,8,1,"Much of this episode is taken up with the wedding of Tyrion and Sansa. The ceremony occurs but there is no consummation. Tyrion is such a neat character because he has heart and soul. Dany has met the person who will be pivotal in the future. The question is how she could let this guy get the drop on her like he does without some sort of commotion. The couple are fleeing those that would harm the baby. Many crows show up to announce the arrival of one of those horrors and a paternal instinct rears its head. These are all very interesting events. Tyrion confronting Joffrey makes on want to cheer, but the boy king is storing away his venom at present. He tells Sansa he will come and visit the fourteen year old in the night. Melisandre continues to worship her sick god and puts leeches on the body of her young sacrificial lamb, after seducing him. She is a sorceress and seems awfully formidable. God action sequences."
380,27,10,1,"Great character development of tyrion, after a long time sansa will be happy. Now we know what drangonglass do."

383,28,10,1,"I thought I'll sleep after watching S03E09.
Sleep has disappeared."
384,28,10,1,"I have to say, after watching this episode, that this is by far the best episode of any series I've watched. Ever. I just sat there, silent, with tears in my eyes, thinking about what I just saw. Speechless and touched. So emotional, so dark, so intense and so brilliantly directed. Highly recommended. Cast in the series is awesome and it's not hard to ""feel"" the characters.I loved every bit of this episode. Music was beautiful, characters were beautifully portrayed, there were funny and sad moments, I just can't describe my feelings while watching this episode and even now, after a few days.I will just say: The North remembers."
385,28,10,1,"Suffice to say that the tradition of the 9th episode of Game of Thrones seasons are still here. The much expected moment left me shaking for minutes after the episode finished.This episode was not only the best of the series but the best of all the episodes of all the series.From the acting, to the directing, to the score, this episode did everything right, and the north remembers.Death is coming for everyone and everything, a darkness that will swallow the dawn.I do not want to spoil anything, just go and watch it right now, watch out for spoilers.10/10"
386,28,10,1,"There is nothing that can prepare you for this latest episode of Game of Thrones. Even those who knew what was coming (which i didn't), will probably be shocked by this incredibly powerful gut wrenching episode.Now, i'm not going to into what happened in depth. I just need to tell anyone who reads this. The Rains of Castemere is arguably the BEST EPISODE OF SEASON 3, and perhaps the best episode of the series. The performances, the writing, the screenplay, EVERYTHING about this episode was PERFECT. Michelle Fairley as Catelyn Stark and Maise Williams put in the best performances of the season. And the ending... So GUT-WRENCHING, HEART BREAKING, SHOCKING AND POWERFUL all at the same time. I'm telling you now, if you thought Game of Thrones was slipping into meritocracy, then this episode will BLOW YOUR MIND. It is UNFORGETTABLE."
387,28,10,1,I've never read the books so everything that happens when I see the program is the first time I've experienced it. I consider this a gift because the show has directions I just can't anticipate. Especially this episode.This episode may be my favorite so far. It was wonderful and absolutely gut-wrenching. Every scene had so much meaning and involved my emotions to the point that I actually cried out during the ending. I've been watching television shows for forty years now and I've never had a show that affected me the way this one does and in particular this episode.The ending.....wow...just wow. I really couldn't believe what I was watching. It tore my heart out and made me realize how unbelievably evil some of the characters are on this show. The acting during that final scene was amazing and I am thoroughly impressed by the production values. This episode is one of the most powerful things I've ever seen on any show. It was stunning and perfect.....absolutely perfect. They couldn't have made it better.
388,28,10,1,"Like images of a long past but soul-ripping War, I remember. I did not see this coming, not at the slightest. Personally I think the only ones who knew, where the ones who read the books. Only them! I did think the Episode was building up to something, an unexpected Ending. Game of Thrones definitely requires more than the ordinary television viewer. This show will challenge you to hold on, like a roller coaster it will sometimes slowly go up, just to speed down, twist and roll till it pushes you towards the edge of vomiting. If you think GoT is a bad series, you probably have no Idea what makes a good one. Enjoy, and try not to fall apart!"
389,28,10,1,"With so many great episodes to choose from, which is the best Game of Thrones episode? I don't know, but for sure this one is a very obvious candidate. Actually, I'd say it is an obvious candidate for best episode in any TV show ever. This is TV history."
390,28,10,1,"I had read the books so I knew what was coming. But I was still flabbergasted by the visceral images as the Red Wedding took place. The whole episode was teeming with suspense and you could feel the tension whether you had read the books or not. I can only imagine how it felt for people who hadn't picked up the subtle foreshadowing of previous episodes. It was spooky how chilling everything came together. But this episode had several more important things happening other than the RW: Jon and the wildlings (which I found boring even in the books) kicks up a notch; Bran experiences some seriously weird stuff that is extremely important to not just his story arc but the entire series. Dany's scenes were typical of her standing around letting the men do the fighting but Jorah is officially friendzoned for life.Though it is tempting, don't skip over Bran or Jon's parts just to get to the end. The payoff of waiting is worth it and you get some character and plot development as well. But Rains of Castamere will go down as one of the most shocking episodes of any TV series ever. This proves that no other show can even touch this series. I can't find one thing wrong with it."
367,26,8,1,"The Bear and Maiden Fair there isn't enough action, however sewing many political matters on several places, the upset Tyrion always wondering lives in a pleasant life escorted by their countless private lovers, he was stiffly imposes by his high-handed father Tywin Lannister forced to marry the youngest Sansa Stark for your despair still mocked by his baggy face bodyguard Bronn and worst having to explains for your bed's mate this new status.The lone King Boy Joffrey forgotten and buried in the kick line feels the bitter taste of the lonely power, he calls his grandfather to a chat at his iron throne complaining that no longer he wasn't received any heed from him, Sir Tywin answers politely added a slight accent of sarcasm and also with refinements of cruelty that he has been bused at Hand's tower and the boy must go there anytime even carried by his servants if possible, the boy swallows his pride on the solitude of throne.Meanwhile at arid lands another meeting takes place, Daenerys the Dragons's Lady envisages a possible attack at the Yunkay city surround by a heavy walls, she calls the powerful Razdal mo Eraz for a fair agreement, he offers umpteen Ships loaded of gold to her withdraw her forces that were besieging the city, although he seemingly is ready for the war and reiforcing that has mighty allies behind.Finally the one-handed Jaime Lannister was set free to be back at Port Royal, nonetheless his escort girl Brienne must stay there for a while, in the middle of the way he learns that the so faithful girl was doomed to die at soldiers's hands , exposing the exact meaning of the name of the episode.

It is regardless another great episode to a season that, up to this point, is as good as any of the consistently very good to outstanding episodes of the previous two seasons. It may be more characterisation and character interaction heavy than action-oriented and may lack the big revelations of the previous episodes, and is not as tightly paced and complex as especially ""And Now His Watch is Ended"". As 'Game of Thrones' is incredibly good at how it characterises its characters and how they interact this is a long way from a problem. This is apparent in ""Kissed By Fire"", especially in the touching interaction between Jaime and Brienne and the hugely intriguing Lannister stuff. Uniformly the acting is superb, especially from a moving Nikolaj Coster-Waldau and Maisie Williams shining in Arya's Brotherhood scenes.Visually, ""Kissed By Fire"" looks amazing. The scenery is throughout spectacular, the sets are hugely atmospheric and beautiful on the eyes with a real meticulous eye for detail and the costumes suit the characters to a tee. The make-up is beautifully done. The visual effects are some of the best of any television programme and are not overused or abused, the scale, the detail and how they actually have character and soul are better than those in a lot of the big-budget blockbusters. As well the cinematography and editing, which are cinematic quality as well.One cannot talk about ""Kissed By Fire"" without mentioning the thematically, orchestrally and atmospherically multi-layered music scoring and the unforgettable main theme. Again, worthy of a high-budget fantasy/action/drama film.It is hard not to be bowled over by the quality of the writing, outstanding isn't a strong enough adjective to describe how good the writing is once again. It always has a natural flow, is layered and thought-provoking and demonstrates a wide range of emotions such as suspenseful tension, poignant pathos and witty humour. The story is paced beautifully, structured with such nuance and attention to coherence, a high emotional level and is done with intelligence, passion and sensitivity.Overall, Season 3 delivers again. 9/10 Bethany Cox"

342,24,9,1,"Kissed By Fire doesn't live up the high standards left by And Now His Watch Is Ended, but it's still another great episode for Season 3. My only quibble is that the pacing's a little bit too long, but again, it doesn't matter and everything else holds up fine.The story/script is still well-written, the performances are still solid, the directing and editing is still sharp, the music score's still beautiful, the relationships continue to shine, and the story-arcs for the Stark and Lannister family continue to be interesting and makes you want to see what's in store for them next.

346,25,10,1,"One of the quieter more contemplative episodes in this outstanding season, episode 6 might not have brought your jaw to the floor as many of the other episodes this season but it had a quiet grace. The perfectly titled ""The Climb"" provided much to think about. Contrasting themes of order and chaos, cynicism and optimism. The final 10 minutes provide perhaps one of the most beautifully shot contrasts of worldview ever done. A contrast between a cynical view of life and an optimistic one, Littlefinger's monologue strikes the viewer in its overall harshness and unfortunate plausibility - that mostly people delude themselves in life, spoken over such convincing supporting visuals as only game of thrones can provide. This scene is immediately followed by a final scene which contrasts this viewpoint that is so beautiful and touching that the viewer feels nearly uneasy. In any other show the final scene could have become meaningless sweetness but in game of thrones it resonates, because we realize that true happiness is rare and fleeting, but we hope that it lasts, we hope Littlefinger is wrong, though we realize, especially in the world of Westeros, he is most probably right."
347,25,9,1,"Another good episode, and with several nice quotes one might want to look back upon several seasons from now:""Chaos is a ladder"". ""I see a darkness in you.

Instead, it is perhaps Season 3 at its most contemplative and intimate. Which is no way a bad thing, 'Game of Thrones' have done these types of episodes several times before and it's always come off brilliantly. ""The Climb"" may start off a touch on the slow side, but for all its intimacy it's a gripping episode where the exposition always serves a point and doesn't bog things down and characterisation is as rich as ever.It is the truly tense scaling of the wall that is particularly memorable here in ""The Climb"". The interaction between Tywin and Olenna is similarly exquisite (especially in their negotiation), as are the honest and emotionally resonant writing for Littlefinger and a visually beautiful and perceptive ending. Arya and Melisandre's scene is beautifully played and written and Theon's treatment here is disturbing.All the acting is superb, with the best performances coming from Charles Dance, Diana Rigg, Maisie Williams and Aidan Gillen.Visually, ""The Climb"" looks amazing.

349,25,9,1,"It's hard to comment on segments. So I would say that there are some broad issues that are constantly in front of us. There is a struggle to tell who the players are as we parse the seven kingdoms that keep being mentioned. The Lannisters seem to have most of the chips, but their manipulations are certainly dangerous and may backfire. Where is Arya going to end up. Why is Theon being tortured by that sniveling little jerk and why does he have so much power over life and death. No dragons this time. She's on her way, though, and what will happen when those things reach full size. It's like having deflated footballs. There is this incredible scene as the winter people climb the ice wall and peer over the other side. Tyrion and his sister are now commiserating over who is whose enemy and whether the dwarf was her target. Does it matter. They are all potentially deadly and blood certainly isn't thicker than water, unless ambition can be satisfied. We are off to the races as the next episode unfolds. The wedding is coming and Littlefinger is using his wiles and trying to manipulate his way to the top."

Robb is still trying to win back the Freys help - his uncle will marry one of the Freys to help since Robb married Talisa.

Maybe there are some deleted scenes, but I'll see if I could find them.Anyway, everything else turned out great.

That it is still a very good episode, from personal opinion anyhow, is indicative of how amazing a show 'Game of Thrones' is. It is more of a set-up episode of what is about to come, and is not the most exciting 'Game of Thrones' has been. It's far from dull though and the story made perfect sense to me. It's not action-heavy and focuses more on the characters, their interactions and dialogue, this is not a problem because actually 'Game of Thrones' have proven many times that they do this kind of episode very well, brilliantly for some, just as much as when they do episodes that are heavier in action. Not everything works. The pacing could have been tightened, and this could have been achieved by in particular by shortening Theon's torture sequences which do go on forever. Wouldn't have said no even to them being excised because they didn't add very much and felt very extreme even for torture.Flaws aside, there are scenes that work extremely well. The final scene is particularly wonderful, tense, thrilling and just spectacular and one of the season's better endings. The Daenerys and slaver scene and the Tywin and Joffrey confrontation are just as brilliant.Visually, ""The Bear and the Maiden Fair"" looks amazing.

363,26,10,1,Another exciting episode with lots of action and a great story
337,24,10,1,This Season is usually talked about for The Red Wedding for obvious reasons but the most impactful scene of the show for me happens in this episode with Jamie Lanister and people who have watched the show or episode know what I'm talking about but it's simply so tragic and beautiful yet subtle the scene that it's my favourite in the whole show. And Jamie Lanister is my favourite character of the show.But even though I think Rains Of Castimere is the best episode of the show. I think this Episode has the best scene of the show.
392,28,10,1,"This episode is the best episode of any show that i have ever seen. I had heard before watching it that it was going to be a good episode, and i expected it to be just as good as many other episodes from the show. When i watched it though, my mind was blown. I literally had my mouth open, staring at the screen, amazed at the intensity of the episode. i wouldn't change a thing about this episode, the directing, acting, writing is perfect. There is a reason its rating is so high, but i think it should be higher. The whole story of the show contributes to the greatness f this episode, the quality of the previous episodes all combining into this one episode. It left me shaking for an hour after it finished, i questioned if what i saw was real, that it cant have just happened. if you haven't seen this episode you have not lived.10000000/10"

The opening shot was amazing and so nice to see Joffrey laying dead. The acting of Lena Heady in this episode is incredible and very realistic. The thing I didn't like was Jaime. His whole character arc that has been building up from season 1 until now actually, is just thrown away in one scene, u know the one. But the ending was amazing.

Hats off to the GOT team for giving us four excellent episodes so far in this season.The fourth episode is a bit different from the first three in the sense that there is less action and more story.

434,33,10,1,"I can't understand at all the bad comments read in IMDb. This is by far one of the best episodes of AGOT. As an avid reader of the ASOIAF books, I'm very pleased with the changes done. They resume quite well many of the story lines, compensate some POVS without action (Bran's POV is a path of wisdom and knowledge in the books), introduces bit of interaction among many main characters, and graduates the information, in a way that G.R.R. Martin doesn't (because of the length of the books and the time inverted in his writing). We are in the meridian of the series, and some pieces have to be put together. In filming, structure and balance are primal. The show can't be exactly as the original source, and the fidelity to this material must be restrained to the characters and the global story. The new material added to the Craster's Keep segment could very well be introduced in the books; and don't apart from them, except the fact that Sam didn't reveal the existence of Bran to Jon. All the sequences are wonderfully written. And Burn Gorman is great and terrifying as Karl, the leader of the traitors. The late sequence show us the White Walkers in a way the book only suggests (the tales of Old Nan and the comments of Craster's wives); it's wonderfully directed, plenty of mystery and fantasy. The controversial scenes of violence and raping are not worst than other moments of the show (some of the infamous soft-core sequences in 1x07 and 2x02) and are integrated in the argument (what do you think the mutineers were going to do with Craster's wives?). Those who hates the changes should watch again the second season of the show; faithful to the events of ACOK... and absolutely unfaithful to anything else, failing in continuous wrong decisions about the characters and the storyline. Please, let's review the TV show by itself: this is a great episode."
435,33,9,1,"Came to 'Game of Thrones' fairly late in the game and due to being so busy the binge-watching was gradual. Have found myself truly loving the show, very quickly becoming one of my favourites. It totally lives up to the hype and not only does it do the brilliant source material justice (a rarity in television) it is on its own merits one of the finest, most addictive and consistently compelling shows in recent years and quality-wise it puts a lot of films in recent years to shame.Personally don't agree with the negativity here respectfully, though can understand the disappointment. There are significant deviations from the source material, more so than usual for 'Game of Thrones', which fans have understandably have considered this a detriment for future episodes and story progression and for continuity's sake. This wasn't a big problem for me actually, being somebody who always judges something as a standalone, something that ""Oathkeeper"" does a great job in from personal opinion.""Oathkeeper"" does have a lot of characters and goings on, and do sort of agree that it would have been better if what happens in the episode was told over more than one episode (two or three) so that everything felt consistently fully formed. However, the story is thoroughly absorbing even when more subdued than the previous episodes, going at an assured pace, having action that leaves one in awe and having some consistently surprising and intriguing story development (yes there is some here). That for the truth behind Joffrey's death is especially a shock.Acting throughout is strong, especially Nikolaj Coster-Waldau and Diana Rigg.Visually, ""Oathkeeper"" looks amazing. The scenery is throughout spectacular, the sets are hugely atmospheric and beautiful on the eyes with a real meticulous eye for detail and the costumes suit the characters to a tee. The make-up is beautifully done. The visual effects are some of the best of any television programme and are not overused or abused, the scale, the detail and how they actually have character and soul are better than those in a lot of the big-budget blockbusters. As well the cinematography and editing, which are cinematic quality as well.One cannot talk about ""Oathkeeper"" without mentioning the thematically, orchestrally and atmospherically multi-layered music scoring and the unforgettable main theme. Again, worthy of a high-budget fantasy/action/drama film.It is hard not to be bowled over by the quality of the writing, outstanding isn't a strong enough adjective to describe how good the writing is once again. It always has a natural flow, is layered and thought-provoking and demonstrates a wide range of emotions such as suspenseful tension, poignant pathos and witty humour. The story is paced beautifully, structured with such nuance and attention to coherence, a high emotional level and is done with intelligence, passion and sensitivity.Altogether, another very strong instalment though will divide fans, particularly regarding its treatment of the source material. 9/10 Bethany Cox"
436,33,9,1,"Oathkeeper is another great episode. It does a nice job continuing where it left off in the last three episodes and the characters are still relatable.The storyline is still well-written, the script is interesting enough, the characters and their relationships continue to be fresh, the directing and editing is sharper, the music score from Ramin Djawadi is still gorgeous as is the scenery, and the dialog is solid. My only quibble is that it doesn't quite reach the same level as episode 1 and 2 in the writing department, although it's not exactly terrible because it's still well-written. So, overall, another great episode despite one nitpick."
437,33,10,1,"First of all I very much liked the change from the book, and the introduction of something quite new, that hasn't been written yet. It must be very important for later storyline and story outcome (finale) otherwise they wouldn't mention it; I surely like the idea of white walkers and their possible role in story outcome. Also I can't understand all the bad comments that I read in IMDb. If book fans (and therefore show fans!!!) expect to see strictly the same story they already read, why they after all watch show, they already know everything? All in this episode is perfectly well executed and written. Some of the alterations that are even possible in the book are very well written and presented. There is nothing bad in this episode it is even one of the best of whole series; Game of Thrones episodes become better and better as the story progress! 11/10"
438,33,10,1,"So much going on. Jaime comes to visit Tyrion who is falsely imprisoned in a dungeon, living in filth. Cersei has accused him of Joffrey's murder, but it must be hard for even she to logically think he is guilty. She hates him for his truthfulness and his smugness. He also knows about her incestuous trysts with her brother. She has gone into protective mode for her remaining son, feeling he may also be in danger. He gets a nocturnal visit from Margery who plays on his adolescent being. He is not like his brother, at least at this point, but he has to know that Grandpa is pulling the strings. Meanwhile, Dany and the gang finally arrive at the Meereen fortress and her forces sneak in and gain the trust and aid of the slaves. Those who crucified slave children pay a price for their evil as well. Brienne is enlisted to find and save Sansa. There are numerous other things going on including a group of cannibals joining forces with the Wildings, doing horrible things to people just for their own evil purposes. Once again they have set up a wonderful set of questions that need answering in upcoming episodes."
439,33,10,1,Another exciting episode with lots of action and a great story
440,33,9,1,"The worlds of Westeros and Essos keep displaying both beauty and brutality, and characters remain delightfully ambiguous. By the end of the episode, we are introduced to a character that will haunt the North for a long time."

446,34,8,1,"More exposition than serious events. It begins with the new king taking over. Cersei talks to Margery, asking her if she will be queen. She says she just doesn't know at this point. She says the right things to stay in good graces. Dany is having some trouble as the new ruler of the conquered city, as offense has been taken and possible retribution in the offing. Littlefinger and Sansa end up in the Ayrie with the crazy queen and her disgusting son. Littlefiner has to pretend to cotton to her wishes until he can move on. He owes her and can't take a chance. Arya lets the Hound know that she is interested in killing him or at least wishing him dead. Roose finally meets his death when Bran uses his special gifts to get rid of him. Of course, Tyrion is in prison and about to stand trial. This should be the focus of the sixth episode."
447,34,10,1,"This season as a whole has been amazing- the storyline has been much more compact, focusing on only a few plot lines each week; as a result, a lot more happens per episode in terms of characterization as well as plot development than what used to happen in the previous seasons. While this season has already given us classics like The Lion and the Rose and Oathkeeper, I feel that this episode one just knocked it out of the park. Every single sequence this episode was extremely well thought out, but I'm going to focus on the three most important things in this episode:Cersei- at first, I was extremely confused by how she was acting, as the things she was saying were extremely considerate of others, not sounding like Cersei at all. I saw a lot of outrage about this on Westeros.org. However, upon rewatch, I quickly realized that she was manipulating the judges to make so as to gain support at the trial. This was amazingly subtle and very well thought out by D&D. Side note: Oberyn Martell is easily turning out to be one of the most memorable characters of the show. Eyrie- everything that went on at the Eyrie was amazing. Aidan Gillen was actually really good this time around, and Kate Dicke was great as Lysa Arryn (glad to have her back). The imagery is truly spectacular. Of course, the highlight of these scenes was Sophie Turner- Sansa has become an amazing character this season, and Sophie Turner has completely aced every scene she's been in. The crying scene was particularly memorable. Finally, Craster's Keep- while some might have viewed this as filler, I found this sequence to be amongst the greatest sequences the show has ever done. Every character, from Bran to Jon to Jojen (MVP of this episode, easily) had really good moments. Sure, it wasn't required for plot advancement. But seriously, seeing how much every other scene in every episode does that, I loved the fact that we got a great action sequence instead this time. Plus, Jojen's vision has become my favourite scene from the show's entire run.So, my ranking of the episodes so far this season:1. First of His Name 2. The Lion and the Rose 3. Oathkeeper 4. Breaker of Chains 5. Two Swords"
421,32,9,1,"Came to 'Game of Thrones' fairly late in the game and due to being so busy the binge-watching was gradual. Have found myself truly loving the show, very quickly becoming one of my favourites. It totally lives up to the hype and not only does it do the brilliant source material justice (a rarity in television) it is on its own merits one of the finest, most addictive and consistently compelling shows in recent years and quality-wise it puts a lot of films in recent years to shame.""Breaker of Chains"" is a slight let down after the incredible ""The Lion and the Rose"", nevertheless it was an excellent episode. Can totally see where people are coming from regarding the much-talked about controversial scene, and while it is open to interpretation that doesn't stop me from not being the biggest fan of the scene respectfully. It was uncomfortable to watch and not only added nothing, other than reminding us of what Jaime is capable of, but didn't fit with the rest of the episode. Personal opinion though.Really liked the story development and direction it's going. It is very hard to follow on from an episode as special and emotionally impactful as ""The Lion and the Rose"" but ""Breaker of Chains"" does so very well if not quite as powerful. The tension and emotion are great, the storytelling absorbs and it is always great to see Daenerys getting meaty scenes and Cersei being more interesting than she has been in a while. Tyrion and Jaime are especially well written here. While all the acting is never less than fine, Peter Dinklage, Emilia Clarke, Lena Headey and particularly Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau are the standouts here.Visually, ""Breaker of Chains"" looks amazing. The scenery is throughout spectacular, the sets are hugely atmospheric and beautiful on the eyes with a real meticulous eye for detail and the costumes suit the characters to a tee. The make-up is beautifully done. The visual effects are some of the best of any television programme and are not overused or abused, the scale, the detail and how they actually have character and soul are better than those in a lot of the big-budget blockbusters. As well the cinematography and editing, which are cinematic quality as well.One cannot talk about ""Breaker of Chains"" without mentioning the thematically, orchestrally and atmospherically multi-layered music scoring and the unforgettable main theme. Again, worthy of a high-budget fantasy/action/drama film.It is hard not to be bowled over by the quality of the writing, outstanding isn't a strong enough adjective to describe how good the writing is once again. It always has a natural flow, is layered and thought-provoking and demonstrates a wide range of emotions such as suspenseful tension, poignant pathos and witty humour. The story is paced beautifully, structured with such nuance and attention to coherence, a high emotional level and is done with intelligence, passion and sensitivity.All in all, excellent. 9/10 Bethany Cox"
393,28,10,1,Would rate this episode as best ever in the whole GAME OF THRONES series!!It thrilled me to the core! 👌👌👌👍👍👍
420,31,10,1,"This is so great. Last episode written by george rr martin. Important episode, and season itself is great because of martin."
418,30,9,1,A new season and this episode doesn't disappoint: It brings us right back in the game.
395,29,9,1,"It would be a tough ask to expect episode 10, the final episode of season 3 of Game of Thrones, to match the quality that many of us witnessed with ""The Red Wedding"". However you will all be pleased to know, that Mhysa is a SATISFYING end to season 3 of Game of Thrones.I will not spoil anything for those who read this, but i will say this: Questions are answered... and new questions have formed. Also, some characters were left without any type of conclusion for season 3. In saying that though, the finale sets up the 4th season of Game of Thrones brilliantly and will have fans eagerly waiting for the next season. To sum it up, Myhsa is one of the better episodes of the series and satisfying conclusion to HBO's epic fantasy, even if it couldn't match the power and incredible scenes witnessed in ""The Rains of Castamere"""
396,29,9,1,"Arya and The Hound escape riding through the massacre of the Stark's army and Arya sees the decapitated body of her brother Robb. When Arya sees a group of drunken soldiers mocking her brother, she steals The Hound's knife and stabs one soldier in his throat while The Hound kills the others. The castrated Theon is tortured and his father and sister receive his penis in a box. Yara Greyjoy travels with fifty men to bring her brother back home. In King's Landing, the Lannisters celebrate the death of Robb. Ygritte reaches Jon Snow and he is seriously wounded by his lover. Davos releases Gendry and gives a boat to him. Sam and Gilly meet Bran and his friends and he gives the dragonglass dagger to Bran. Daenerys is worshiped by the former slaves of Yunkai. ""Mhysa"" is the engaging final episode of the Third Season of Game of Thrones. Arya kills a man and let's see how her action will affect her. Theon received what he deserved. Joffrey is messing around with his grandfather and he will certainly regret of his attitude. Daenerys' army continues to increase. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): ""Mhysa"""
397,29,9,1,"So much to think about. I had wondered about Theon for an episode or so. He is in the hands of that sadist and worse and worse things are happening to him. This is hard to watch. For all his failings, this unending torture is a bit over the top. Sending his male parts to his father is about as vicious as anything imaginable. Tyrion continues to bate Joffrey and is taking some mighty chances, banking on his father needing him to complete his task. During all this we must ask ourselves if uniting these forces is even within the real of possibility. Danys is out there accumulating bodies to fight for her. She has become a liberator and is now the darling of the masses she is freeing. She has never lifted a finger to fight and yet has the charisma and power to make things happen. There is also that conflict that love puts in the way that is unresolved. Theon's sister has made a vow to bring him home, even though his father won't do a thing. She is going to recruit fifty of the most ruthless killers and head off to free him and her resolve has been very impressive. We also have the sorceress who worships the fire gods actually accepting expediency over personal gratification (who knows, maybe she has had this all along). Then there are are the wanderers. The Stark boys. John Snow. Shot full of arrows and reuniting with Sam. And what about Jaime. He finally appears in the chamber of his sister/lover. He is missing a hand and looks beaten. What is going to happen to him? Great writing, setting up more and more possibilities. Before seeing this and looking at Episode Nine, I thought that the future was so stacked, but there are limitless possibilities. Very nice wrap to the third season."
398,29,9,1,"It's been an exhilarating and emotional season, more spectacular that the previous two and yet retaining a tight narrative focus, the multiple plot strands cohering beautifully."
399,29,10,1,"To avoid spoilers, my review of ""Game of Thrones"" Season 3 will be necessarily brief, dependent as this show so often is on the key betrayals that affect its plot. In short, I loved it, and I'd give it a 10 out of 10. I don't know why I've felt so reluctant to do that ... maybe because I used to view it as too mainstream, given its zealous and seemingly universal fandom? This would be a dishonest review if I didn't admit that I was hooked on the show I used to make fun of.It has some of the best acting and dialogue in recent memory. The show might be worth watching for Peter Dinklage and Charles Dance's verbal sparring, alone, for example. Now, in this third season, Jon Snow and Daenerys finally evolved into heroes that I could actually root for. (They seemed a bit thinly rendered up until now.) I actually cheered when she wiggled that deal to purchase ""The Unsullied"" slave army. And there was just more ... fun stuff -- dragons, White Walkers, melees, surprise attacks, etc.At times the show feels slow to me -- its is still pretty chatty, and neither the White Walkers nor Daenerys' forces will ever win a war by moving swiftly. After three years of the show, they're ... still moving south and north, respectively. Rommel would have routed them easily.And, at times, ""Game of Thrones"" is too dark even for me. The scenes of torture and the bloody betrayals among allies' sometimes make me think that the writers (or George R. R. Martin himself) simply wish to depress their audience.Those things can't prevent me from being just as hooked on this as everyone else, though. Great stuff."
400,29,9,1,"Another great episode, letting us recover from the previous episode, while also setting things in motion for the next season. By there way, there's some brilliant foreshadowing here."
401,29,10,1,Great way to finish the season. Really sets it up for the next

403,29,9,1,"Season 3, episode 10. Arya is still with The Hound who is protecting her. Bran and his company meet with Sam and Gilly, Bran learns Jon Snow should be at the Night's Watch if he's still alive and about the White Walkers. Bran insists on leaving with his company to the North of the Wall. Sam and Gilly end up at Castle Black. Daenerys and her army invade Yunkai and free the slaves. Jon tells Ygritte goodbye, she shoots him with arrows in anger and he ends up at Castle Black. The Night's Watch sent ravens out to ask Stannis for help. Davos frees Gentry. Yara Greyjoy goes after her brother Theon to free him with a small army of men. Jaime Lannister and Brienne make it back to King's Landing. 9.5/10"
404,29,10,1,"After an intense previous episode, this finale is so great and in my mind underated. It deserves a 10/10, what a great music and such an end."
405,29,10,1,"Mhysa is another classic episode in Season 3. Not only does it have a great cliffhanger to Season 4, but it also has some great twists along the way.Much like episode 9, there aren't any faults I have with this. The storyline/script's still well-written, the dialog is smart, the performances are still compelling, the characters are still interesting, the relationships are still endearing, the pacing's much tighter, the direction and editing is even more sharper and focused, the scenery is still beautiful, and Ramin Djawadi's score is even gorgeous and builds up the atmosphere perfectly. So, overall, another great season finale and looking forward to review Season 4 today."

It may not be the most plot-development-heavy (in terms of the episode itself) or twisty episodes. It also ends on an admittedly uplifting and hopeful but also rather anti-climactic note, that isn't the going out with the bang one expects (Daenerys had a much better final scene in ""And Now His Watch is Ended""). What ""Mhysa"" does do brilliantly is set things up for Season 4 and propel the action forward, making one highly anticipating the next season rather impatiently. It also excels just as well in past characters, that didn't get the focus they should have before, making welcome and well overdue returns after long absences. ""Myhsa"" was quite a poignant reunion episode of sorts and the softer and character-focused approach, while still having plenty of tension and resonance, to the storytelling was appreciated. Acting is superb all round, it is hard to follow on from Michelle Fairley's tour-De-force performance in ""The Rains of Castamere"" but everybody with no exceptions are more than up to the task, and on the dramatic front only the final scene didn't quite work for me. Direction is fine.Visually, ""Mhysa"" looks amazing.

Everything is done brilliantly, the episode just could have gone a little bit further. 9/10 Bethany Cox"
408,29,10,1,Just I am in love with show every episode I see I come and write a review just so greatly ended . Excited what's about to come
410,30,10,1,"This episode was definitely worth having 4 hours sleep. The Dragons have grown larger, the CGI that created them is so perfectly mastered, it's outstanding! Kit Haringtons and Sophie Turners acting has improved greatly, in S2/3, I cringed when Sophie (Sansa) talked, but now, her acting is perfect! She really deserves more screen time.I love the banter between Arya and Sandor (the hound), again, Maisie Williams acting has improved so much! The fighting scene was perfectly orchestrated, it seemed real.A new character has arrived! Prince Oberyn Martell of Dorne, played by Pedro Pascal. Even though he did only get about 10-20 minutes of screen time, his acting was superb! He played the character extremely well.An epic start to the season! Now to watch it again at 9PM!"
411,30,10,1,"Personally I didn't expect too much for the new season start, as in the books it is rather a long winding role play before the Purple Wedding. However I loved to see the fact how the character of the main actors is developing and changing. The acting was absolutely fantastic in my opinion. I was impressed after viewing the first episode, because I found a parallel in between the title ""Two Swords"" (and the actual forging of them) and the storyline of this episode. Don't know whether this was just making up in my mind or whether the author intended to do this:Two Swords - Two Atmospheres1. Wrath - Anger - Hate: The Hound, Arya, Daenerys, Oberyn, Mance Rayder, The Wildlings2. Desperation - Sadness - Pride: Jaime Lannister, Cersei Lannister, Jon Snow, Shae, TyrionCan't wait for more!2 thumbs up!"
412,30,8,1,"Tywin gives a sword made of Valyrian steel to Jaime and orders him to return to Casterly Rock, but Jaime refuses to go. Tyrion is assigned to welcome Prince Doran Matell but he learns that his brother Oberyn will attend the wedding instead and has arrived earlier. Tyrion finds Oberyn with his mistress in the brothel and he finds that he hates the Lannisters. Cersei gives a golden right hand for Jaime and her maid discloses information about Shae that she had overheard. Dontos meets Sansa to thank her for saving his life and gives a necklace that belonged to his mother to her. Tormund and the wildlings team up with the cannibals Thenn under the command of Styr. Jon Snow recovers from the injuries and goes to a hearing with the leaders of the Night's Watch. Arya and The Hound reach a tavern with five men and The Hound is forced to fight against them. Arya kills two men, one of them with her Needle. Daenerys find 163 slaves nailed to crosses and she reaches the front gate of the city of Meereen.""Two Swords"" is a warm start of the Fourth Season of ""game of Thrones"". The story introduces the dangerous and amoral Oberyn Matell. Daario Naharis that was played by Ed Skrein has been replaced by Michiel Huisman, who does not have any resemblance with the original actor. The impulsive Arya forces The Hound to fight again against a great number of opponents. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Two Swords"""
413,30,9,1,"The first episode in all seasons has been more like an allusion to what comes next, and two swords just served that purpose. ' Vengeance - ' lannisters are not the only ones to pay their debts' - with that Oberryn is introduced, who is seeking revenge against the lannisters for the gruesome murder of his sister.Arya is shaping into what looks like one psychopath girl, who now has the audacity to kill for what is rightfully hers. Honour - with the new sword being forged from the ICe - Ned's sword, the honourable house of Starks has fallen, Ser Jamie Lannister is still struggling to get his honour back as a knight in the Kingsguard , refusing his inheritance to Casterly Rock. There is Danearys , struggling to tame her own dragons, trying to bring the honur back to the house of Targaeryans.there was Jon Snow, trying to regain his position in the night's watch, and the wildlings still fighting.Emotions - Cersei tussling with her own thoughts, her love for Jamie now estranged! Brienne still trying to restore Catelyn's honour, and Sansa now becoming strong, and Shae turning green with envy.This episode had action, story and drama. Shot with attention to the minutest detail, the graphics( dragons have now grown big), their clothes, two swords marks a great beginning to the season 4."
414,30,10,1,"Two Swords not only does a great job introducing new characters, but also continuing the story lines for the Stark and Lannister with a few twists and turns. There aren't any faults I have with this episode because it's a classic and it's a great start to Season 4.The performances are still great, the storyline/script is even more fresh, the pacing is superb and doesn't drag, the relationships continue to shine, the scenery is gorgeous, the CGI graphics is really solid (even the look of the dragon in Daenerys' story-arc, which looks pretty cool), the action is really interesting, the music score is still beautiful, and the directing is terrific. So, overall, a great start to the fourth season. :)"

It does a fabulous job with introducing new characters and re-introducing past ones, while advancing what was shown before. One just wishes that more thought was put into the casting change for Daario, the lack of physical resemblance is too jarring and didn't feel like the same character.In terms of standout scenes, the highlight for me is the final one between Arya and Sandor. All the acting is superb, the always-never-less-than-great actors such as Peter Dinklage, Charles Dance and Jack Gleeson still shine, Sophie Turner has really grown as an actress and the new characters make a strong impression, Pedro Pascal particularly note-worthy.

416,30,9,1,"With season 4 making it to the screens, many a reviews came out as the season didn't began as they expected it to be. As GRRM still on the 6th book of the ""a song of ice and fire"" series, the producers are in no hurry to catch up to him, as each of their yearly season is based upon each book Martin wrote in quite a lot of time. Seeing as the producers have to cover up a ""storm of swords"" that was half left with the end of the previous season, I'm quite sure they think of covering up this book as well as the next in the series ""A feast for crows"" . With 10 episodes each year, they can fill up as many gaps as they can and try to go with the books but going according to the pages will be quite a lot of work and since each season has an yearly gap between it , this idea would seem impossible. Furthermore the 4th season of Got began with a good start as they have to cover up a lot of story in coming 9 episodes, let's just hope they deliver 180 days of shooting with pure excitement."
417,30,9,1,"In terms of plot progression, ""Two Swords"" offered minimal movement. However, the superb execution of this episode demonstrates the confidence and skill that David Benioff and D.B. Weiss have accumulated over the past three seasons."

336,24,8,1,"Jon Snow is questioned about the defenses of The Wall. Then he goes with Ygritte to a cave where they have sex. Daenerys asks her officers who should be their leader and they indicate Grey Worm. Lord Rickard Karstark kills the Tywin's grandsons and Catelyn, Talisa and Edmure advise Robb to keep Rickard as a hostage since if he executes Rickard, his men will leave him and return home. However Robb beheads Rickard in the name of the justice and he loses half of his army. Jaime and Brienne are delivered to Lord Bolton and he gives accommodations to them and Jaime's arm is treated to avoid gangrenous. The Hound defeats Dondarrion and is released by the Brotherhood. Tyrion makes financial arrangements with Oleanna to share the expenses of the wedding. Then Cercei and he are summoned by their father that explains that each one of them will get married.""Kissed by Fire"" shows Jon Snows breaking his vows of Night's Watch with Ygritte. Robb's sense of justice has brought losses to him. The mysterious Lord of Light is powerful and revives Dondarrion that is killed in combat by The Hound. But the Machievellian Tywin uses Cersei's poison to makes arrangements for the marriage of his children. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Kissed by Fire"""
335,24,10,1,"What a lot to absorb. Jaime's actions as a ""king killer"" are finally revealed. During a time in a bath, talking to Brienne, he reveals that what he did was actually noble, but that Stark had no interest in hearing his side of the story. He is a complex, multi-dimensional character. There is another supernatural element at work here, as well (for me, the less magic and non-earthly things, the better) with the revivification of the leader of the no banners group and the Hound. John Snow is finally seduced and it turns out that he is quite a lover. He is now fully embraced in his new life with his new people. The most intriguing plot development has to do with Tyrion and Cersei, who are now to be used as pawns to join certain factions in the war, and to squelch the efforts of one group to create a marriage of convenience politically. This sets up a whole raft of possibilities. Meanwhile, Dany has made all her new soldiers free men, and, in the process, attained great loyalty from them. They will be great fighters because they are like automatons. I'm looking forward to the next installment."
334,23,10,1,Liked some of that conversation between Margaery's mom and Cercei
257,18,10,1,What an episode . . . The real treat from HBO. The work done by director is awesome. According to me ... best i have seen on TV serial. Blackwater bay was one of the big battles of the books and a complete episode just for this battle was amazing. Game of thrones is setting new standard on small screens.A truly justice done to George R R Martin books. I have read all five books of Ice and Fire. And according to me Third book gives damn shocks. Heard that book 3 will be divided into 2 seasons. That means 20 episodes story line will go even more deep. Damn we have to wait for future episodes and also for Winds of winter to release.Hats off to you guys.
258,18,10,1,"56mins of Spine-Chilling Awesomeness!!! The best episode I've seen yet.. Game of Thrones keeps getting better and better! I have the full set of books but after watching 19 episodes, I decided not to read it because it might spoil the story, I'd rather watch the TV series. Perfect acting, the details of the war.. Just don't have enough words to express how awesome this episode, and the entire series as a whole was! This episode was a thriller!I sure am going to miss it since there is only one more episode left for the season, cant wait for the next season to begin!"
259,18,9,1,"Episode written by novelist George R.R. Martin himself, the script here drips with sarcasm and is crisp as ever delivered by the show's fine actors. The sense of danger and urgency is omnipresent, the dialogues and monologues epic and the battle brutal, strategic and intense, even though like most of Game of Thrones it is purposely poorly lit.A great episode following the high level of acting/directing in Alan Taylor's ""The Prince of Winterfell"" and ending unexpectedly with the entrance of a prominent character.Tyrion, Cersei and Catelyn's characters dominate the screen time and shine while the cowardly young king punctuates a few dark moments. Politics, power, friendship, love and warfare intermingle in a delicious night to remember."
260,18,10,1,"WOW is all I can say. Now this is what I call great TV.Plot In A Paragraph: Stannis has arrived to take Kings Landing and the Battle Of Blackwater begins. Hands down the best episode of ""Game Of Thrones"" so far. On the whole, this episode really has no low points. Sophie Turner really shines in this episode, and she shares some good meaty scenes with Rory McCann (The Hound) Lena Headey (Cersi) and Sibel Kekilli (Shae) Jack Gleeson is fine as Joffrey who's too young and frightened to risk his own life while Stannis is perfectly willing to do so, leading the battle from the front. Stephen Dillane's Stannis comes off really well in this episode and Conleth Hill's Varys always shines, But this episode is all about one of my favourite characters and actors in the show Peter Dinklage's Tyrion Lannister. I have often praised his work on this show in my reviews. He won the Emmy for his work in the first season, and he should win another for his work in this episode alone. From the scene with Shae in bed where he talked about his nerves, to his rousing Speech to rally the troops after Joffery had fled to his work on the battlefield. He is simply superbIn the end, this is the show's finest hour in two seasons, and it's fitting it's the hour written by George R.R. Martin."
261,18,10,1,Fking Great. Didnt even notice an hour has passed.
262,18,10,1,"Blackwater is by far an excellent episode for Season 2. It does a nice job continuing the story lines from the previous episodes and the action pieces during the episode are terrific. There are no problems I have for Blackwater.The performances are still great, the story/script is still well-written, the dialog is fresh this time around, the pacing is much tighter and doesn't drag, the directing is really good, the music score suits the action moments really well, the editing is sharp, and the scenery is still gorgeous. Also, the character relationships never fails to be interesting. So, overall, a classic episode and a sign that things are getting progressively better. Next episode review, coming right up."
263,18,10,1,"Seriously a 10 is not enough for this episode. Chills through and through. Every other scene.
There is no side I support. There are no clear lines drawn out about the hero side and the villain side, you are immersed in the battle and the characters on both sides.
The men fighting and the women grouped together by Cersei create some spine chilling moments. Some moments stood out less obvious than others. The scene where Sansa picks up the doll Ned gave her. Oh and the last shot with Cersei telling Tommen the story of a lion cub while sitting on the iron throne and ready to poison him."
264,18,8,1,"In ""Blackwater"", Game of Thrones' typical style is radically changed, which starts with the fact that the usual handful of locations are narrowed down to only one, King's Landing. This is, of course, serving the purpose of the huge battle at Blackwater bay, which gives the episode its title. The main cast contracts pertinently and only 11 of the usual 25 are left – something that on the other hand enhances the focus on those particular characters. Especially Tyrion, Cersei, and Sansa have more screen time than usual and guest writer George R. R. Martin, author of the show's source material, the ""A Song of Ice and Fire"" series, includes a multitude of important character information into the cleverly written and grandly acted dialogs. However, it's unlikely the awkward conversations between Queen Regent Cersei and Queen to-be Sansa about the possibility of the latter getting raped by Stannis' troops, nor the entertaining ""F—k everything"" attitude of our canine friend in the King's Guard, Sandor Clegane, that audiences will remember about this episode. What happens in the last five scene of ""Blackwater"", with an absolutely stunning twist that will leave your mouth wide open during the whole ending credits, makes it a fan- favorite. But first things first: it actually takes the episode quite some time to gain momentum and not one scene in the first quarter of an hour was really something special. The looming fleets of Stannis Baratheon excited me and looked really good, yet I knew that this wasn't nearly the full potential of the show. Slowly but surely, one-time Game of Thrones director Neil Marshall manages to get the right mood on the screen and once Tyrion's sellsword Bronn lets loose of his fiery arrow in the direction of Stannis, the episode's mood varies dramatically. The following wildfire explosion is unbelievable, but the battle isn't over, it has just begun. Before we get to massive bloodshed in front of the Mud Gate, however, there's a cut to Cersei and Sansa, fifty-fifty voluntarily getting drunk in Maegor's Holdfast, where they are separated from the martial outside world. And then, in the second half of ""Blackwater"", an unforgettable battle commences, that is understandably small scale in comparison to cinema blockbusters, but includes umpteen awesome close-combat killings, fantastically realized by director Marshall. Much of the gore scenes, that made the show quite notorious for TV circumstances, are there as well and they are so artistically done that it's impossible to not have fun with it. But it wouldn't be Game of Thrones if the final scene weren't a jaw-dropping surprise. Lena Headey as Cersei is amazing in an extremely emotional finale that alternately shows her and her son Tommen in the Throne Room and Tyrion and Stannis on the battle field. All of this is almost too enthralling to watch and culminates in the arrival of Loras Tyrell. Remember, the audience doesn't know on which side he and his family are on at this point and that makes the scene with him entering the Red Keep one of the best moments in the whole show.""Blackwater"" is undeniably one of the most rememberable Game of Thrones episodes, even though I personally found the first third to be too slow and also found several inaccuracies and logical flaws (How does Stannis now that Tyrion is responsible for the Wildfire? How can Stannis climb up the latter to King's Landing first of all without anyone of the Lannister's attacking him?). I do think that the hype about this episode is a bit disproportionate, but ""Blackwater"" is nevertheless one of the show's highlights."
265,18,10,1,"Magnificent, breathtaking, awesome, heart-racing, courageous, dark, bloody, and epic. Just a few words and adjectives here to describe what might be one of the Five Best episodes in All of Game of Thrones IMO. Writing, score, tone, plot, acting, dialogue, cinematography and camera work/angles, depth, even character development, These are all things that needless to say get a solid 10 from me regarding the delightful but of course brutal Blackwater - off the Amazing Second series of Game of Thrones. It's a treasure to just watch this episode alone let alone its season or the whole series... well 1-7 I mean duh
If you're a GoT/Song of Ice and Fire fan I'm sure you know, watch all the time, and love the brilliant, bleak, nocturnal piece that is Blackwater, an Episode so good that I would go as far as to say it's a top 25 episode of any show ever for me personally. It's tremendous viewing. Absolutely fantastic and peak GoT in all its glory"
266,18,9,1,"Who will stand at the head of all the battlers. This is a great episode with amazing battle scenes. There are close calls, changes of strategy, close quarter beheadings, point, counterpoint, pyrotechnics. It's sort of an invasion of Normandy kind of setting with the battlements, archers firing as the troops, most of them fodder for the attack, fall along the way. There are a series of unanswered questions and the fate of several people is at stake. Mostly, we want to know what is going on with Tyrion who has actually been betrayed though he fought valiantly and saved the king's backside. Who will now sit upon the throne or is it all's well that ends well? We shall see."
267,18,10,1,"this is the best episode of the whole series and the second best battle scene I've ever watched, as soon as a big chunk of stannis baratheon's fleet gets ambushed by wildfire and the music kicks in when stannis arrives at king's landing with his remaining soldiers, you get a real adrenaline rush, it's THAT awesome lol, this was a real treat for the fans. I can't wait to see the battle of castle black on season 4, it'll top blackwater I heard, and it'll be drawn out, bloody, gory, intense, brutal, exciting, and adrenaline rushing just like blackwater was :-). season 4 will be insane, it'll have more action, more blood, and more gore than ever before, the fans are in for a real treat since a storm of swords is balls out insane"
268,18,10,1,"Came to 'Game of Thrones' fairly late in the game and due to being so busy the binge-watching was gradual. Have found myself truly loving the show, very quickly becoming one of my favourites. It totally lives up to the hype and not only does it do the brilliant source material justice (a rarity in television) it is on its own merits one of the finest, most addictive and consistently compelling shows in recent years and quality-wise it puts a lot of films in recent years to shame.""Blackwater"" for me is Season 2 at its finest and is one of the greatest 'Game of Thrones' episodes, containing everything that makes me in love with the show in the first place. In response to my review title, my personal answer is that it is an extremely strong contender. Everything in relation to the battle is truly spectacular, epic in scope, rich in emotional impact and a non-stop thrill ride, while also having an appropriately uncompromising and far from rose tinted depiction of warfare. Those who say that it is the best battle sequence ever produced for television hit it on the head from personal opinion.'Game of Thrones' has always delivered in the acting. ""Blackwater"" is no exception and would go as far to say that it is one of the show's finest examples. Peter Dinklage is a fan favourite for very good reason and Tyrion continues to be one of the show's most consistently interesting characters. A big shout out also has to go to Lena Headey in her finest hour of the show up to this point, her final scene wrenches the gut.Visually, ""Blackwater"" looks amazing. The scenery is throughout spectacular, the sets are hugely atmospheric and beautiful on the eyes with a real meticulous eye for detail and the costumes suit the characters to a tee. The make-up is beautifully done. The visual effects are some of the best of any television programme and are not overused or abused, the scale, the detail and how they actually have character and soul are better than those in a lot of the big-budget blockbusters. As well the cinematography and editing, which are cinematic quality as well.One cannot talk about ""Blackwater"" without mentioning the thematically, orchestrally and atmospherically multi-layered music scoring and the unforgettable main theme. Again, worthy of a high-budget fantasy/action/drama film.It is hard not to be bowled over by the quality of the writing, outstanding isn't a strong enough adjective to describe how good the writing is once again. It always has a natural flow, is layered and thought-provoking and demonstrates a wide range of emotions such as suspenseful tension, poignant pathos and wit. The story is paced beautifully, structured with such nuance and attention to coherence, a high emotional level and is done with intelligence, passion and sensitivity.Can't fault the direction either. Nor the writing or development of the characters, most shows could only wish to have characters with this amount of depth and complexity.To conclude, truly fantastic. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
269,19,10,1,"I was beginning to feel that somehow the Season 2 of Game of Thrones may not be able to live up to the expectations of the viewers, partly because of a couple of weak episodes in later half of the series and due to lack of the awe-factor which TV viewers had experienced during magnificent events of Season 1. But the Blackwater episode more than made-up for those inadequacies and Valar Morghulis brought about a thrilling conclusion to a very solid season. This episode is specially remarkable given the fact that many plot arcs depicted here are distinctly different than the books and yet somehow, despite being a loyal book reader, I felt that those changes have made the story lines even more interesting. There are subtle hints which give a glimpse of what is about to come in this epic saga, which all culminate into a spectacular climax (that is all I can do not to give away any spoilers). I really don't know how anyone can stop themselves from picking up the 3rd book of the series after watching this episode."
270,19,10,1,"This is Game of Thrones, always setting high standards..and after a jaw-breaking episode of last week, this week's episode provided enough spine chilling scenes to fill our appetite... Season Finale which actually gathered 4.2 Million Viewers on its initial airing broke another record as its now 2nd most watched TV show on HBO ever.. The only thing bad about GoT is, that it has 10 episodes a year, i would prefer a regular 13 episodes a year.. now we have to wait another 10 months probably, for Season 3...its a good idea to start reading the books in the hiatus... and one last thing "" Winter is Coming "".. it may come earlier than anyone thinks as we saw a sign of it in the Finale"
271,19,9,1,"Tyrion is not rewarded but ostracized instead. Joffrey rewards Lord Tywin, Littlefinger and Loras Tyrell that asks Joffrey to marry his sister Margaery and he puts Sansa aside. Sansa is happy for his decision, but Littlefinger advises her that Joffrey will not stop bothering her and offers to help her to escape from Ling's Landing. Robb marries Talisa despite the advice of Catelyn that is against. Brienne saves Jaime from three Stark men that have recognized him on the road. Theon and his men are under siege in Winterfell and Dagmer stabs Luwin with a spear; hits Theon and they flee, burning Winterfell to the ground. Arya, Gendry and Hot Pie cross paths with Jaqen. He tells to Arya that he is going to Braavos and invites her to go with him. The say farewell to each other and Jaqen calls Arya Stark by her name and changes his face. Daenerys enters in the House of the Undying and is tempted by the Iron Throne; by Drago and her son; and she finally finds her three dragons that burn Pyat Pree to ashes. Then Daenerys finds that Xaro is a liar and does not have a fortune and she locks him and his lover Doreah in the safe. Jon and Halfhand have a sword fight provoked by Halfhand and Jon kills him, earning the confidence of the Lord of Bones. Sam is left behind and sees an army of wights and White Walkers heading to the Fist. ""Valar Morghulis"" is the grand finale of Season Two or a great beginning of the next season? Tyrion's fate is a great deception since he was the responsible for defending King's Landing. The journey of Brienne and Jaime is promising. Will Theon succeed to escape from Stark lands? Jaqen is the great mystery for the next season. Daenerys's dragons are really a great menace for the Seven Kingdoms. Jon now is close to the Wildings and we will see how he will be affected. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): ""Valar Morghulis"""
272,19,10,1,"What a masterful bit of writing. I am in awe of writers who can keep such a ship afloat. What do they do? First, they develop fascinating, multi-dimensional characters. Next, with all the different kingdoms somehow engaged, they create a balancing act that is believable and carefully crafted within the world Martin gave to us. Thirdly, the dialogue is excellently crafted, with wit on the one hand and mayhem on the other. We have the beauty of a series where the bad guys often get away with things, where retribution doesn't always work. Where people die, even though they seem to be principles in the show. I cannot wait to see how things play out in Season 3."
273,19,10,1,There are quite a number of surprises and one cannot imagine a more ominous final scene than the one here.
274,19,9,1,"I couldn't see anyway that Season 2 was going to live up to the 1st Season, for me, Season 1 was faultless. Game Of Thrones: Season 2 did a solid job in continuing the fantasy epic, it built on the characters very well, moved along at a pleasant pace and stayed true to its roots with its impeccable dialogue and story-telling.As a whole, the season is quite slowly paced, dedicating much more time to character building. The introduction of new characters is always a tricky task, especially introducing several in a short space of time. Within the first 3 episodes we are shown 6 or 7 new characters, many of which go on to have very important roles in the up and coming seasons. Existing characters which got little screen time in season 1 are also given larger roles whilst also focusing heavily on the already established characters from the previous series. Tyrion is featured heavily in this season building on his likable reputation even more while other characters are given more screen time and you really start to despise them. John Snow, Arya, Theon and Joffrey all especially stand out for me with solid performances and important story lines. A TV show has never had the ability to make me dislike certain people as much as Game of Thrones and Season 2 goes a long way to making this happen. Even the small-time characters which have little screen time have a remarkable knack of being interesting and intriguing – nobody feels out of place or unnecessary.The production from start to finish looks great, the sets, CGI, costumes and locations are all perfect again. Watching this show in HD with a decent surround sound system is quite the experience! Season 2 is gruesome and explicitly violent, contains strong nudity, strong language and delves deeper into the fantasy realms than its previous series. It isn't as strong as season 1 but it is a strong second season, offering everything that you would want. The story is told perfectly and the introduction of many more characters is implemented faultlessly.The pacing is spot on and scenarios start to unravel very nicely, tension is built and many questions are left unanswered – making you want to keep on watching! Daenerys scenes can get a little tiring and repetitive but this part of the show is very important for future episodes and when looking back, the character development you see of her is very significant.Season 2 ends on a strong note, exploding in episode 9. Previous episodes build up to this perfectly and the climax doesn't disappoint. With an estimated budget of $8,000,000 for episode 9, it shows off its power with an incredible battle scene, you forget that you are watching a TV drama, with a budget like that, it's an easy mistake. Episode 10, gets back to normal and ends the season on a strong note, a real cliff-hanger, giving you a small taste of what is to come!My only real negative from the whole season was the Daenerys storyline, I felt that it started to drag a little towards the end and the climax felt a little flat. However as I said before, looking back on this storyline, you really get to see significant progression in her character which is very important for future seasons.Overall, Season 2 is weaker than Season 1 but that was hardly a surprise for me as the first Season is one of the strongest I have ever seen out of any TV show. Season 2 does however build characters very strongly with many characters stepping up with much more screen time and fascinating stories. It includes various, very strong plots and answers questions from the previous season, contains some very solid stories and leaves key questions unanswered for future episodes. Season ratings so far: Season 1 – 10/10. Season 2 – 9/10."
275,19,9,1,"This episodes is a mix of tying up loose ends and building up suspense for next season. By the way, look out for Daenery's vision, as this will be a scene to remember several seasons later."

It is not quite as spectacular as ""Blackwater"", for me the ""Baelor"" of Season 2, but everything that is so good about 'Game of Thrones' is in full throe and to exceptional quality.'Game of Thrones' has always delivered in the acting. ""Valar Morghulis"" is no exception. Peter Dinklage is a fan favourite for very good reason and Tyrion continues to be one of the show's most consistently interesting characters.

277,19,10,1,"Valar Morghulis wraps up the story lines left by the previous episodes perfectly and sets Season 3 up nicely. Sure it did drag a little bit longer, but it doesn't matter. Everything else turned out great. The performances are still great, the character relationships are still interesting, the writing is really good, the story is well-done, the editing is sharp, the music score from Ramin Djawadi is still great, and the directing is still good. Also the script is still well-written as it gives the actors plenty to shine with their delivery.Now that I've finished reviewing Season 2, I have three more to go if I want to catch up on the sixth. So, overall, classic episode and great set up for Season 3."
256,18,10,1,"What a thrill! I don't even know where to start.""I hate bells..."" Varys said. But viewers do love them. Unlike the other wars that happened in Game Of Thrones, or should had happened (Because they were cut off) This was the first one that was showed completely. This episode (written by George R.R. Martin himself) was the best one yet. I was seating on the edge of my seat and couldn't believe what was going on...The whole season has been developing to get here, the war... and boy what a war... I dare to call it a perfect 10.... I won't spoil it, go ahead and watch it!"
278,19,8,1,"Apart GOT really is a great series, has too many characters to put in just sixty minutes, the episode has to split on short scenes in each point of the Wasteros kingdom, the wounded Tyrion no longer is the hand of the king, but decides to stay, Tywin replaced him by King Joffrey, Petyr Baelish got his own land due is remarkable help to won the battle, the strong Brienne has a clash on the road to protect the ironic Jaime from a bunch of the Staks, Theon makes an uplifting speech, sudden stopped be a bothered soldier, Winterfall collapse by fire and Maester Luwin has died by spear, Daenerys visit in a castle finding his already died husband and his son, and others character on short appearance, this ending part suggesting a mystical happening, smat lines is allowed for everyone, great but too complex to follow!!Resume:First watch: 2019 / How many: 1 / Source: Blu-Ray / Rating: 8.5"

Good trick, Theon."
253,17,10,1,"It is incomprehensible to me why the episode has such a low acceptance. is a sure 10/10. It may lack the intensity of other episodes, but it has nice dialogues that you can enjoy."
230,15,8,1,"The Old Gods and the New is another good episode for this season, but it's not without some small flaws that I might have to over a bit. Some of the editing particularly in the beginning is a bit terrible and the pacing did drag a bit long. However, this episode overcomes those flaws by maintaining the show's greatest strengths.The performances are still great, the story is still good, the script (despite the terrible editing) is still well-acted, the scenery is still gorgeous, the relationships continue to shine, and the music score is still beautiful this time around. So, overall not a great episode, but despite it's small flaws, it's still very good."
231,15,10,1,Really good really fun and addictive but I don't have any money on it and I don't have to pay for it haha is the way to you and you don't have to pay for it
232,16,10,1,"Tragic events accumulated in Winterfell in the previous episode, ""The Old Gods and the New"", and that location is just where ""A Man Without Honor"", the 7th episode in Game of Thrones' 2nd season, commences. Theon Greyjoy, newly proclaimed Prince of Winterfell, awakens in his bed- chamber on his own – without Osha, the wildling whoring herself around the castle last episode. But as we've already seen a glimpse of there, her services were for the purpose of freeing Bran and Rickon Stark from the custody of the one GoT character who presumably received more death wishes than King Joffrey since the last episode, the aforementioned Theon, who now initiates a hunt for the two boys. And our hatred for him becomes bigger and bigger.Meanwhile, wildling Ygritte is giving her captor, Jon Snow, more sex offers than Ros and Shae are giving their johns combined and war is just around the corner in King's Landing (Stannis is only still absent, though. Probably nursing the baby demon his semen produced.) Saying hello as well, in case you forgot about him, is Jaime Lannister who also asserts the audience that he isn't in the field of the sympathetic characters, while detecting who is good and who is bad gets quite fuzzy in Qarth, from now on the bloodiest city that ever was or will be.All of those story parts provide for constantly thrilling entertainment and you really have to look carefully to find flaws with them. The only things I didn't enjoy that much were Arya conversing with Tywin Lannister (why, yes, because Arya acted foolishly stupid and besides the last dialogue sequence about the correct pronunciation of 'my lord', it didn't include much that we haven't already seen from those two), what happened between Jaime and Alton Lannister (too long and actually rather silly), and Shae getting weirdly aggressive once her new BFF Sansa Stark deals with puberty. But those are small events in the whole of a great episode that is equally dramatic, gory, and romantic.Just as in ""The Old Gods and the New"", Jon Snow/Ygritte and Daenerys moments were above anything else, by far. The mysterious disappearing of the Khaleesi's dragons in the last episode leads to a shockingly awesome scene involving Pyat Pree, a warlock that ups his creepiness every single time he's on screen. The mysterious disappearing of Qhorin Halfhand and his Night's Watch fellows (come on, Jon and Ygritte really didn't run away THAT far.) leads to more superbly written bantering between the two left behind. Cersei being fully honest with Tyrion seemed more than just out of place, but nevertheless, the performances of the two actors made it look genuine after all.""A Man Without Honor"" had some other small gems in it, but without writing that much, I'd name it the second best episode of this season up to this point. The anticipation for the imminent war is killing me and the fantastic cliffhangers (yes, plural) made me watch the next episode right afterwards."
233,16,9,1,"Very good coming of age events. The princess discovers she is of an age to have children and now must give herself to Joffrey. Theon moves on way over his head. He chases the Stark boys with thoughts of their deaths. Catelyn may finally show the hate and emotion she has saved up for the King Killer. Jon is put in a terrible place, listening to the Wilding girl abuse his manhood. He has to hearken back to his oath to the watch. This, unfortunately, brings him into great jeopardy. Anya is becoming entertainment for her captor; he is able to speak frankly with him. She is feeling her way out, having thoughts of murder, but she is also respectful of him (to a point). Shadow people kill most of the Thirteen and the Mother of Dragons has only one goal: to get her ""children"" back so she can pursue her quest. There is a great deal to think about, moving into the next episode."
234,16,8,1,"Osha wakes up early in the dawn and leaves Theon's room, stabs a guard and flees with Bran, Rickon and Hodor. Tywin believes that the murder of Amory was an attempt against his life and orders Gregor to burn villages to the ground. Sansa menstruates during the night and tries to hide it with Shaw but they are surprised by The Hound and Sansa has a meeting with Cersei. Jaime kills Alton Lannister in his cell and when Torrhen comes to see, he strangles him and flees. However he is captured and Lord Rickard wants to kill him for the death of his son Torrhen but Catelyn protects Jaime. Jon Snow searches the Night's Watch patrol with Ygritte and she leads him to an ambush. Daenerys finds who had stolen her dragons, as part of a coup d' etat in Qarth. ""A Man without Honor"" should be named ""men without honor"" since not only Jaime, but also the ambitious Theon and Xaro do not have honor. Impressive the scene of the two children's bodies totally burned. What will be the fate of Jon Snow and what will happen do Daenerys are two great questions for the next episode. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""A Man Without Honor"""
235,16,9,1,"Season 2, episode 7. Oh why did you have to do what you did and say what you said to Catelyn Jamie Lannister?! I was trying to find a way to someway, somehow like him but now he's really upset me! Well, so much for having pity on Jamie. *Deep sighs*. Jon is struggling with Ygritte. My heart is going out more and more to Sansa - she's now a young woman. Theon hunts down Bran after he escapes - and grows more vile with each episode. Daenerys has her dragons stolen. And some touching moments between Tyrion and his sister Cersei. Really great episode!I have to say that Pyat Pree (and the other wizards like him) look like something out of Star Trek OST. Ha-ha.9.5/10"

Other previous episodes had scenes that were bigger, bolder and more memorable, something that ""A Man Without Honour"" is slightly lacking in comparison in. Having said that, the episode's quieter tone, meditative pace and that it was more character and interaction driven and more intimate and less focused on action was appreciated.It is the characterisation and the character interaction that makes ""A Man Without Honour"" the great episode that it is and elevates it to a stronger level, although it was already an impeccably well made, written and acted episode. The only missteps are Arya made to look a little foolish and the overlong and not particularly necessary scene between Jaime and Alton. Otherwise, Maisie Williams and Charles Dance act their scenes beautifully, while the Jon Snow/Ygritte and Daenerys moments and the character of Pyat Pree are Season 2 and show-so-far highlights.Visually, ""A Man Without Honour"" looks amazing. The scenery is throughout spectacular, the sets are hugely atmospheric and beautiful on the eyes with a real meticulous eye for detail and the costumes suit the characters to a tee.

237,16,10,1,"You get so much character development in this episode, it's fantastic. Things become darker and grittier for everyone involved in this well written entry. There's so much to enjoy; Jon and Ygritte's amusing banter and bickering, The Arya/Tywin dynamic, Jamie Lannister is the grown man in the holding cage and most of all Theyon loses his soul. I love the tidbits that are offered up with The Hound being ""The Hound"" and Shia's devotion for protecting Sansa. All of that is great, but Theon's judgment was one of my favorite moments in the entirety of this show. No matter how many time I watch this episode and that scene it NEVER gets old. The look of Shock and awe on Maester Luwin and even Theon's expression was enough to shink my heart into my stomach. Oh and that fade to black is an amazing cherry on top. There more bloody and gory moments throughout the other episodes, but since the first time I saw this episode my reaction has never changed. This is my ~5th time binge watch this series and...that fade to black!"

240,16,9,1,"Don't get me wrong. Episode 5 and 6 were still good episodes, but they weren't as great as the first four which did a great job continuing where the story lines left off in Season 1. This episode, on the other hand, is an improvement and is another great episode. Sure, some of the new characters had little to do, but it doesn't matter.The acting's still great, the story and script are well-written, the relationships are still great, the moments with Daenerys are good (when she finds out her dragons have been taken, it left a cliffhanger to what would happen in the last three episodes which is very satisfying), the music score's still great and the pacing is fine.Overall, another great episode and looking forward to review the next three episodes. :)"
241,16,10,1,I like how all the blood spurts out when they get their throats slit
242,16,9,1,"A Man Without Honor was another excellent episode, a dialogue-heavy series of scenes that once again showed why this show is one of the best on television when it comes to drama and characters that you will inevitably love."
243,16,10,1,"This episode is the season highlight for me, with a lot of intrigue going on in all corners of Westeros, and Essos as well."
244,17,9,1,"Jon Snow is brought to the Lord of Bones that wants to kill him, but Ygritte saves him claiming that he is a Stark. Jon sees that Halfhand that was captured and he wants Jon as a spy of the Wildings. Luwin sees Osha in the crypt and she shows Bran and Rickon alive, and the burned bodies belonged to the farm boys. Stannis and his fleet is arriving to King's Landing and Tyrion is plotting a plan to defend the castle, while Joffrey shows a false courage. Robb arrests Catelyn for releasing Jaime Lannister from his cell to exchange him for her two daughters. ""The Prince of Winterfell"" is an engaging episode and fortunately the two Stark boys are alive. Joffrey's bravado is disgusting and let's see if he will have the bravery that he shows to the court. Catelyn's betrayal is unforgivable and has deeply affected Robb and the other Lords. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): ""The Prince of Winterfell"""
245,17,8,1,"We need to line up the chess pieces at some point. Theon is convinced that the two brothers are dead, burned to a crisp, even though they have escaped. Catelyn has betrayed her son. All her talk of the necessity is just that. I know that somehow we are to see the wisdom of what she does, but I don't see it. The Lassiters are as cruel as can be and it is really hard to imagine any compassion on their parts. Of course, with Tyrion in a command position, there is internal hemorrhaging going on. It's interesting that despite his limitations and physical size, no one dares take a shot at him. Now we have Jon Snow, captured by the Wildings along with his comrade, being driven across the icy wastes. Arya and her friends have managed to get away with the help of her benefactor. King Joffrey has bought into the idea that he is a warrior. Tyrion laughs at the thought. Jaime is in a canoe being paddled down the river. Bring on the last two episodes."
246,17,8,1,"Season 2, episode 8. Another interesting episode. Stannis is nearing King's Landing expecting to take the Iron Throne for himself. Tyrion is preparing for war with Stannis Baratheon and has cross words with his sister Cersei. Ayra and her friends are planning an escape from Tywin Lannister. Catelyn Stark let's Jamie Lannister go with Brienne holding him prisoner for a bargaining tool with the Lannisters in hopes to get her daughters back. Robb Stark gets angry with his mother Catelyn for letting Jamie go and he is falling in love with Talisa - starting to refuse to marry the woman he's promised to. Jon is being held captive by Ygritte and her people. 8.5/10"
247,17,9,1,"I found ""The Prince of Winterfell"" to be quite a relief... It was a relatively quiet hour, at least by Game of Thrones standards... But unlike last week's equally placid installment, this one was gilded with numerous character moments."
248,17,9,1,"While we wait for what seems to become a big battle for King's Landing, stories and characters keep developing."
250,17,8,1,"""The Prince of Winterfell"" doesn't include any action scenes at all, but you feel that it serves as the preparation for what happens in the next episode and as that, I found it to do a very good job. However, D.B. Weiss and David Benioff, the creators of the show, don't desist from including outstanding drama moments. Most of those happen in King's Landing where people seem to be in direct preparation for war (the whole setting just looked a little too calm for me considering the looming battle) while Harrenhal also gets its deserved attention. Not really in the fore anymore (rhyme alert!) are the story parts with Jon Snow and Daenerys, but I sense huge surprises waiting for them nevertheless in the final two episodes of season two. Winterfell and the Stark camp receive a fair amount of screen time as well, Stannis and Davos return after a short absence with a rather forgettable conversation that only includes one important sentence in two minutes of talk. Alrighty then, lots of stuff to talk about!Perpetually entertaining, but notably great in this episode were the several scenes at King's Landing, every single one involving Peter Dinklage as Tyrion Lannister. The only Emmy-winning cast member of the show never disappoints with his acting, yet in this episode, I honestly found more joy in the actors sharing the scenes with him. Lena Headey went back to being bitchy, the solitary thing she does better than having sex with her brother. Then there's Jerome Flynn as Bronn, spitting out hilarious one-liners pretty much every time he opens his mouth, Conleth Hill as Varys, whose only job seems to be having interesting conversations with all sorts of royal family members in the city, and Sibel Kekilli as Shae, the German actress who always failed to impress me until this episode and the ones before it, in which she mostly overcomes the unnaturalness she's had until that point.Maisie Williams once again did a terrific job as Arya - her conversation with Jaqen H'ghar may have been the best moment of ""The Prince of Winterfell"" – but I found the group conversation in Tywin Lannister's dining room to be unnecessarily prolonged. Another scene overstaying its welcome happened in the tent of King Robb. Lady Talisa telling him a story of her childhood was definitely unneeded, yet it resulted in her taking her clothes off, which relativizes my criticism. I mean, as objective as I try to be in my reviews, that girl got a helluva booty. In a completely different matter, Brienne of Tarth got to spend time with Jaime Lannister, arguably the funniest scene this episode had to offer.Rose Leslie didn't lose her charm, only her screen time in this episode while seeing Qhorin Halfhand again made for some nice dialogue. Sam, Grenn, and that other nameless Night's Watch fellow who's never gotten an introduction, but is somehow there since the beginning of this season, use their time to dig comfort stations, during which Sam discovers a rotten Night's Watch cloak. Well, that was thrilling.Across the Narrow Sea, more specifically in Qarth, Daenerys is spending way too much time on whether or not to rescue her stolen dragons from Pyat Pree, thus the one scene there, her discussion with Jorah Mormont, was virtually useless. Now, to finally come to the episode's title, ""The Prince of Winterfell"", there's Theon Greyjoy, the douchebag with daddy issues who recently killed Bran and Rickon. But, why is Isaac Hempstead- Wright's name included in the opening credits, then? An interesting solution comes at the end of the episode.All in all, I enjoyed ""The Prince of Winterfell"" quite a lot and best of all was the way the tension for the following episode was built. Practically every story part in this episode was a set-up for the big season finale starting with ""Blackwater"" and left me wondering about all the things that could possibly happen. Way to go!"
251,17,9,1,"Came to 'Game of Thrones' fairly late in the game and due to being so busy the binge-watching was gradual. Have found myself truly loving the show, very quickly becoming one of my favourites. It totally lives up to the hype and not only does it do the brilliant source material justice (a rarity in television) it is on its own merits one of the finest, most addictive and consistently compelling shows in recent years and quality-wise it puts a lot of films in recent years to shame.It is agreed that ""The Prince of Winterfell"" is basically an episode setting things up for the Season 2 finale. The good news is that it does it brilliantly, while not quite being one of the best episodes of the season. Like ""A Man Without Honour"", ""The Prince of Winterfell"" is less action-driven and focuses more on the dialogue and the character interaction. It is a fairly subdued and intimate episode and that is in no way a bad thing, due to it handling this approach pretty brilliantly. ""The Prince of Winterfell"" has a few scenes that bring it down somewhat. The Stannis and Davos scene, while acted well, is far too short for the two characters to be memorable let alone shine. More problematic are the overlong and pointless Daenerys and Mormont and Robb and Talisa scenes, compared to the other interactions and scenes they were just not that interesting and didn't come over as relevant to the story.Luckily, many scenes and interactions are incredibly compelling. Brienne and Jaime, Varys and Tyrion, Arya and Jaqen, Tyrion and Joffrey, all brilliantly done. Joffrey and Theon continue to be nasty pieces of work, Joffrey is still the more evil of the two but Theon is coming close to his level with every episode.Visually, ""The Prince of Winterfell"" looks amazing. The scenery is throughout spectacular, the sets are hugely atmospheric and beautiful on the eyes with a real meticulous eye for detail and the costumes suit the characters to a tee. The make-up is beautifully done. The visual effects are some of the best of any television programme and are not overused or abused, the scale, the detail and how they actually have character and soul are better than those in a lot of the big-budget blockbusters. As well the cinematography and editing, which are cinematic quality as well.One cannot talk about ""The Prince of Winterfell"" without mentioning the thematically, orchestrally and atmospherically multi-layered music scoring and the unforgettable main theme. Again, worthy of a high-budget fantasy/action/drama film.It is hard not to be bowled over by the quality of the writing, outstanding isn't a strong enough adjective to describe how good the writing is once again. It always has a natural flow, is layered and thought-provoking and demonstrates a wide range of emotions such as suspenseful tension, poignant pathos and witty humour. The story is paced beautifully, structured with such nuance and attention to coherence, a high emotional level and is done with intelligence, passion and sensitivity.Direction is strong. Even stronger is the acting, with the high points being Maisie Williams and especially Peter Dinklage. Jack Gleeson, Alfie Allen, Lena Headey, Nikolaj Coster-Waldau and Gwendoline Christie are also high up.Overall, extremely well done. 9/10 Bethany Cox"
252,17,9,1,"The Prince of Winterfell is another great episode in Season 2. My only is that only two scenes felt a bit too long and unnecessary and could've furthered the story a bit. However, it didn't bother me that much and everything else still turned out fine.The performances are still great, the character relationships are still great as ever before, the pacing (despite how slow the beginning was) is still fine, the music score is still great, and the story/script is still well-written. It also does a nice job setting up the last two episodes. So, overall, great episode and great set-up. That's all I have to say. :)"

312,22,9,1,"Lots of plot elements. One king is dead. Dany is still trying to raise an army and must deal with a slave trader who is despicable. She is willing to part with one of her dragons to get what she wants. The thing is she is the mother of dragons. Can she even strike such a bargain (if you get my drift). We will see. Lots of stuff in the woods as Arya goes on and the Pie Guy stays behind to be a baker. Theon is nearly killed but seems to have a guardian angel. This series is filled with near misses and last minute rescues. Jaime, his confidence overflowing, plays too much of his hand (so to speak) and pays dearly for it. His sliminess knows no bounds, but he should realize that he is playing fast and loose with a pack of barbarians. This is a fast moving, well constructed episode. Tyrion is there for comic relief this time. He is made ""Master of the Coin,"" which appears to be the treasurer. He says he doesn't know finance because he just spent money; he never kept track of it."

There may be bigger and more epic episodes, but it is nonetheless as thrilling as the episodes that are those things and there is some boldness in ""Walk of Punishment"". Especially in the truly shocking final moments. Even when you know it's coming when it's spoiled for you before watching the episode, it is one of the most harrowing endings of the earlier seasons.My only real issue with ""Walk of Punishment"" is that the Arya and Hot Pie didn't interest me as much as everything else in the episode, some of it felt somewhat clumsy and didn't add very much. However, all the acting is great with the top honours going to the ever brilliant Peter Dinklage (who has yet to put a foot wrong) and a searingly intense Nikolaj Coster-Waldau. For a first-time directing job, this is a seriously impressive effort, what is so good about 'Game of Thrones' is a long way from diminished here. Visually, ""Walk of Punishment"" looks amazing.

314,22,9,1,"Another good episode, making this the best start of any Game of Thrones season (up until now, anyway). Watch out for the amusing chair positioning scene - or what you might call a mini ""game of thrones"" - in the small council."
315,22,9,1,"Great episode, and distinctly different from the previous ones, with significantly more humor."

317,22,9,1,"Walk of Punishment and the first two episodes are great, albeit not excellent and so far, it's been off to a solid start.

322,23,10,1,I must say I am a little bit biased towards this show. It is because I have read the books and I love them. Therefore in my fanboy-mindset I will praise this show too much. But in my honest opinion I believe that this genre not yet thoroughly explored is one of the most emotionally thrilling thing I have ever seen. This show may not be to everyone's taste but for those that know what they want it is the best thing that has happened to them. To those of us that have read the books this episode was one that many had been waiting to see how it 'll be executed and I must say I am thoroughly pleased. Never before have I been so excited as to scream at the screen ''EPIC EPIC EPIC'' and to have goosebumps!Combining superb acting skills that make you love some characters and completely despise others. This show is full of intricate schemes and epic moments that will take you on an emotional roller-coaster that you will never forget. And I must praise(kudos) the writers for executing it as well as it is written in the books. To cut things short I recommend watching this show! LET THE EPIC FLOW THROUGH YOU.I highly recommend this show and rate it at 10/10.
323,23,10,1,"How much can one squeeze in a fifty minute session. We have the freeing of Theon and his savior being something unexpected. Joffrey begins to be influenced by his bride to be. Tyrion is researching again, trying to find proof of his potential murderer. There is a mutiny. And, ultimately, we see Dany asserting her authority, working a system and playing on the idea of freedom. Meanwhile, Jaime has been abused to the nth degree. He has been forced to drink horse urine and shoved in the mud. But his companion brings back a possibility of dignity for him. It's interesting how those who were despicable can pull at our hearts when their adversaries prove even worse. Cersai is up to no good and tries to gain some modicum of respect. She will endure. We can see that."
324,23,8,1,"Jaime is humiliated by his captors and Brienne unsuccessfully tries to protect him. Tyrion meets with Varys and he tells how he was sold to a sadistic sorcerer that castrated him. He advises Tyrion to be patient and finishes opening a large box and Tyrion sees the sorcerer locked inside. Joffrey shows The Great Sept of Baelor to Margaery and Cersei realizes that Margaery has Joffrey under control. Then she meets her father and tells that she is worried since Margaery is manipulating Joffrey. Varys meets Oleanna and they have a long conversation about Sansa. The Margaery meets Sansa and she tells that they would be sisters if Sansa married her brother Loras. The Hound is judged by The Brotherhood without Banners through a trail by combat. Theon is led by the youngsters that saved him to meet his sister Yara in a dark chamber and soon he finds that his escape was another sadistic means of torturing him. Lord Commander Mormont tries to calm down his men that are starving but one of them kills Craster and another one stabs Mormont on the back killing him. Sam flees with Gilly and her son through the frozen woods. Daenerys has a surprising attitude toward Kraznys mo Nakloz and leaves Astapor with her dragons and the army. In ""And Now His Watch Is Ended"", the arrogant Jaime is humiliated by his captors. Varys explains to Tyrion that revenge Is a dish best served cold. Theon is receiving what he deserves and it was good to see him back to the chamber of torture. The situation outside The Wall seems to be out of control with the murder of Lord Commander Mormont. But the best part of the show is Daenerys attitude in Astapor. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""And Now His Watch Is Ended"""
325,23,10,1,"And Now His Watch Is Ended is by far the best episode in the entire season, but it's not the only one (I'll get to the last two episodes of Season 3 later).

Have to agree with this, certainly better than the previous still great episodes. While ""And Now His Watch is Ended"" may not be one's definition of action-packed, the themes of revenge and betrayal have very rarely been this enthralling, even when character and dialogue-heavy. Up to this point in the season, it is the tightest paced, where things felt fully settled, in terms of introducing new characters and advancing older characters and subplots, and the most emotionally complex. ""And Now His Watch is Ended"" starts in a way that carries on from the end of the previous episode ""Walk of Punishment"" and reminds us of that ending's shock value, and the brutal shocks, emotional complexities and surprises keep coming. Right up until the highlight of not just the episode, but of the season, the mind-blowing ending with Daenerys, now a character you don't want to under-estimate.While the acting is superb across the board, the biggest mention has to go to Emilia Clarke, up to this point it was her best acting on the show and still holds up as one of her finest hours.Visually, ""And Now His Watch is Ended"" looks amazing.

Without giving anything away, let me just say that viewers who found this season's previous episodes sluggish will be really pleased.There's a lot going on in this episode. All the varied elements that we've come to expect from Game of Thrones at its best are here: emotion, action, humour, cliffhanger.Highlights - Ciarán Hinds makes his first move; I couldn't wait to see him get into the action. Meanwhile it's heartening to see another actor from the cast of HBO's Rome introduced: Tobias Menzies as Catelyn's brother, Edmure Tully.There are also some powerful emotional scenes, spectacularly acted and directed.I especially loved Tyrion and Pod's antics in this episode. In a TV show all about war and death, the lightheartedness is a welcome relief.Altogether a great episode. Can't wait for the next one!"

Even Arya gets a little more screen time as well and shines in her relationships with two of the slaves she befriended in Season 2.Overall, another great episode for the third season."

The treatment of Tywin despising his son Tyrion explains part of the behavior of the imp. Sansa does not know that Littlefinger betrayed he father and Ros's pertinent advice to Shae is relevant. But the most promising part of this season seems to be Daenerys and her dragons. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Valar Dohaeris"""
287,20,9,1,"Jon Snow is in the snow, making his way into the hearts of his captors. He claims that treason is a small price to pay for his end game. Joffrey is certainly feeling his oats but may begin to wonder at the price he may pay for his coming marriage. Margery has the should of the people and stops in a dangerous place to talk to some orphans about the courage of their fathers. She promises that the king will look after them. The queen is obviously disturbed because her Freudian connection may be severed (she has so many edges). Tyrion gets to talk with his father. He finds he has been used again. The family, it would seem, is the center of things, yet Tyrion must always prove himself. The fact that his mother died giving birth to him trumps everything and his accomplishments are constantly diminished. It would appear that the dwarf brother is starting to realize that he has no friends at all. As a matter of fact, it is clear that should he consider carrying on his relationship with the woman he loves, she will be killed summarily. The balancing of all factors going forth in the war is the strength of this episode. We also have Dani trying to raise an army and coming on a pack of 8,000 mercenaries who have killed babies to get where they are. Her dragons are not mature, but she needs troops now and it will be interesting if she will go along with the wishes of the evil."
288,20,9,1,"Season 2 ended with ""Valar Morghulis"". It's only fitting that season 3 should start with ""Valar Dohaeris"", the second part of the High Valyrian greeting. Particularly so as this season starts off right where we left off in season 2. But this episode is not about lingering in the past. It nicely sets the stage for the new seasons with new subplots and interesting scenes."
289,20,8,1,"A perfectly calibrated masterclass demonstration of how well these showrunners understand the material, its pull and its rhythms, and the patient dedication of the audience they have summoned to join them around the campfire."
290,20,8,1,"GOT is hard to make a proper review, due has many forefronts split in same episode, some has just few minutes, retellings those facts will be boring to the readers, then I will try describe the main scenes which has a most meaningful interest, after the battle Tyrion Lannister was imprisoned in a room, received an unfriendly visitor Cersei, warning him over his near appointment with the king Tywin, in fact it happens, however the conversation wasn't satisfactory to the little boy, his demand was refuses, due his bad behavior to rules mixing pleasure instead his duties, Jon Snow was taken by Ygritte to settlement to talk with Mace Ryder, he asking what's the real purpose to joint to them, the answer can decides the death or..., in other side Daenerys wants a big army, and goes to Aspator to know the special soldiers, fine episode that stats the third season!!Resume:First watch: 2019 / How many: 1 / Source: Blu-Ray / Rating: 8.5"
291,20,9,1,"Came to 'Game of Thrones' fairly late in the game and due to being so busy the binge-watching was gradual. Have found myself truly loving the show, very quickly becoming one of my favourites. It totally lives up to the hype and not only does it do the brilliant source material justice (a rarity in television) it is on its own merits one of the finest, most addictive and consistently compelling shows in recent years and quality-wise it puts a lot of films in recent years to shame.""Valar Dohaeris"", with my review summary referring to its English meaning, is a great Season 3 opener. Even if there were episodes from the previous two seasons that were bigger and bolder and understandably new ideas and characters gave the impression of still settling. They for my liking weren't quite used enough, with the episode deftly reminding us briefly but deftly of events from Season 2 and expanding them. Just my personal opinion. It may sound like ""Valar Dohaeris"" is not a good episode, actually as said already it's a great one with so much done brilliantly.The characterisation of the older and popular characters continues to excel with some memorable scenes and subplots that weren't as interesting or developed in Season 2 expanded. Appreciated highly the advancing of Daenerys'. In terms of memorable scenes, the exchange between Tywin and Tyrion packs a big emotional punch and is one of Season 3's strongest moments dramatically.Peter Dinklage, Charles Dance, Kit Harrington and Emilia Clarke are particularly wonderful here and Ciaran Hinds in his introductory appearance is a welcome addition.Visually, ""Valar Dohaeris"" looks amazing. The scenery is throughout spectacular, the sets are hugely atmospheric and beautiful on the eyes with a real meticulous eye for detail and the costumes suit the characters to a tee. The make-up is beautifully done. The visual effects are some of the best of any television programme and are not overused or abused, the scale, the detail and how they actually have character and soul are better than those in a lot of the big-budget blockbusters. As well the cinematography and editing, which are cinematic quality as well.One cannot talk about ""Valar Dohaeris"" without mentioning the thematically, orchestrally and atmospherically multi-layered music scoring and the unforgettable main theme. Again, worthy of a high-budget fantasy/action/drama film.It is hard not to be bowled over by the quality of the writing, outstanding isn't a strong enough adjective to describe how good the writing is once again. It always has a natural flow, is layered and thought-provoking and demonstrates a wide range of emotions such as suspenseful tension, poignant pathos and witty humour. The story is paced beautifully, structured with such nuance and attention to coherence, a high emotional level and is done with intelligence, passion and sensitivity.Direction is superb as is, even more so, the acting with not a single weak link.In conclusion, great and a great sign of what was to follow. 9/10 Bethany Cox"
292,20,8,1,"Season 3, episode 1. Tyrion is still not respected by his family - even after the battle of Blackwater and Tywin surely will not give him Casterly Rock even though it should rightfully be his. Cersei still can't be trusted - she is plotting against Tyrion. Robb has his mother put into a room that acts as a cell for her letting Jamie go. Daenerys is gathering an army. Littlefinger is still trying to talk Sansa to leaving King's Landing with him. Joffery is still interested in Margaery. Stannis is back with The Red Woman licking his wounds from his defeat at the battle of Blackwater. Jon is making a pact with the Wildlings. 8.5/10"

Am aware of the dislike for the previous 'Game of Thrones' episode ""Oathkeeper"", mainly for the significant deviations from the source material, personally don't share it. My only real complaint for ""First of His Name"" is the really corny Jon and Karl fight scene, which comes off more unintentionally silly than tense. What ""First of His Name"" does brilliantly though is looking back on past events and providing the answers that were very much needed for some time. Yet it also still sets us up too for future events in succeeding episodes. It is not a fast-paced episode and is exposition-heavy, but it was an episode with so much content that it did not need a fast pace and needed the time for the events to unfold. The exposition too is interesting, providing answers to long-probing questions and moving things forward and preparing one for what is to follow.All the cast are superb yet again, especially Aidan Gillen's Littlefinger and Lena Headey as Cersei (am really liking that Cersei has been more interesting this season than before in previous seasons). The writing for Littlefinger and the female roles here (especially for Cersei and Sansa) is pretty exceptional.Visually, ""First of His Name"" looks amazing.

298,21,9,1,"Bran continues in his dream world. A boy about his age keeps appearing and soon takes on a corporeal being. The three kids are grabbed up by a group of renegades and kept with them. Arya challenges on to a fight and he soon disarms her. Unfortunately, as they are about to take off, a discovery is made, and not for the good. Theon is tortured. I can't quite figure out how the torture device works, just that when some big screws are turned, he shrieks in pain. We get another look at Joffrey, who is trying on clothes for his wedding and the future Mrs. Joffrey, Margaery, is up to something. Joffrey continues his arrogant defiance of his mother and she is biding her time, knowing that this match is good, even thought she is highly suspicious of the girl. Tyrion is visited by his paramour and continues to warn her that his father will not hesitate to kill her for his own pleasure. He is in love and this could be a problem in the future. Peter Dinklage is excellent and is becoming more and more endearing as he is persecuted for being a rake and for things he can't control (his size/the death of his mother during childbirth). Margaery takes Sansa to see her mother and they discuss what Joffrey is really like. The mother is a tough cookie, and she tells Sansa that they can be trusted. What is said makes for an interesting future. The dragons are on the shelf for this episode, which is fine with me, although Dani's negotiations to secure an army to take her ""rightful"" place make it interesting."
299,21,8,1,"Bran has another strange dream and out of the blue, the boy of his dreams appears in their camp and introduces himself as Jojen Reed. After a moment of tension, Jojen and his sister team up with the group they head together to The Wall. Theon is tortured by his captors but a servant releases him and he rides to meets his sister. Loras Tyrell escorts Sansa to meet his sister Margaery and their grandmother Oleanna. The old lady asks to Sansa how Joffrey is like and after a moment of reluctance, Sansa tells that he is a monster. Robb and his mother Catelyn leave Harrenhal to go to the funeral of her father. They are also informed about the fate of Winterfell and that Bran and Rickon are missing. Arya, Gentry and Hot Pie are captured by the Brotherhood and brought to an inn to eat and drink. But they also capture The Hound and Arya's identity is disclosed. Jaime lures Brienne and takes her spare sword and they fight on a bridge, but they are surprised by riders from the House of Bolton led by Locke. ""Dark Wings, Dark Words"" is another good episode where the viewer is introduced to the witty Lady Oleanna Tyrell and Sansa opens her heart. Will she regret for disclosing her true feelings? Is Oleanna a trustful person? So far, most of the nobles are despicable beings. Who is torturing Theon? What will happen with Brienne and Jaime? My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Dark Wings, Dark Words"""
300,21,10,1,"There were no 'epic' climaxes. No battles, nobody lost their heads, but i don't think i've ever finished a Game of Thrones episode feeling so satisfied. This episode was beautifully shot, beautifully written and just a pleasure to watch.New and highly anticipated characters we added flawlessly to the story. Diana Rigg and Paul Kaye were great. As was Thomas Brodie Sangster and Ellie Kendrick. Story lines advanced strongly. New depths were added to characters furthering even their portrayal in the books. I truly did not want this one to end. Brilliant"
301,21,8,1,"This episode was very exciting as it settled the direction of many story-lines that were really going nowhere.Bran was finally told what talents he possesses by someone very mysterious. The adventure of Arya comes to a halt because she meets someone who recognizes him. The boring pair of Brienna and Kingslayer might be in danger again. And suspicions also arise about what Lord Bolton might be up to, in Robb Stark's camp.The feminist element in the series is still relevant as we're introduced to a new character, Lady Olenna Redwyne. She is a sly, witty and very astute women who practically leads Tyrells and is unlike any women we've seen in the series before. She and Margaery have their own schemes and they have already begun moving the pawns forward. I am sure they'll add more excitement to the show.On the whole, I like where this is going and I am excited for what may come."
302,21,10,1,"This episode maybe starts a little bit slow, but it's soon lifted by several brilliant conversations, deftly displaying the depths of several of the characters."

The season's second episode ""Dark Wings, Dark Words"" is even better. Things feel more settled, more is done with the new characters and their story lines while deftly reiterating those of the older characters and advancing those. It's not the biggest, most epic or boldest of 'Game of Thrones' episodes, and more intimate and character heavy, but all the better for it due to how many characters it introduces. The start of the episode is a bit slow, but overall there is a lot going on and a lot of characters but this is not a case of being over-stuffed or over-crowded.All the acting is fine across the board, Peter Dinklage is particularly brilliant of the non-new characters, not a surprise as he is always a high point of the show.

306,21,9,1,"Season 3, episode 2. Brienne and Jamie are still on their way to King's Landing - and having a go at each other as usual. Jon Snow is still with the wildlings while the Night's Watch are making their way back to the wall. Robb is told that he may loose the war since he married Talisa. Robb aslo learns of what happened to Winterfell and that there are no signs of his younger brothers. Ayra and friends runs into a group of men -- which leads Ayra and The Hound face to face. Bran and group are now with Hodor, Meera and Jojen. Theon is tortured into telling why he took Winterfell. Shae tells Tyrion of Littlefinger and Sansa's meeting. Joffrey and Margaery are getting closer.9.5/10"
294,20,9,1,"Valar Dohaeris does a fantastic job continuing where the last season left off and is very interesting to see new characters appear. The relationships are still good, the performances are still good, the script is well-written, the story's solid, the scenery and music score's great, and the directing along with pacing is tighter and does give a lot of atmosphere to the background and the characters.My only quibble is that the new characters had little to do and I would love to see more of their lines, but it doesn't matter. Everything else turned out fine. Overall, a great beginning to Season 3 and I would love to review the rest sometime today."
424,32,9,1,"Breaker of Chains isn't nearly as excellent as the first two, but it's still a great episode. Yes, the pacing does feel a bit uneven and the rape scene was a bit unnecessary, but those are the only problems I have and everything else turned out fine.The performances are still good, the storyline/script continues to be well-written, the directing is still solid, the relationships continue to shine, the editing is sharp, the music score is still beautiful while maintaining a sense of atmosphere, and the characters continue to be interesting. So, overall, not nearly as excellent as the first two, but it's still interesting."
